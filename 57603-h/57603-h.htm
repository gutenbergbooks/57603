<p class="h3">PROLOGUE</p>

<p class="indent">The June sun, lighting up the yard of the big
white house, lights up a pretty scene. To begin
with, the yard is pretty in itself, with its
stretch of emerald lawn, its trim gravel sweep, its
linden tree, in which the bees are humming, its fragrant
masses of purple lilac; but though one feels all
these things, one looks at the people in the yard. Two
ladies, in light summer dresses, sitting on the steps
by the kitchen door; two children, riding a pony by
turns, shrieking with glee. Both ladies are good to
look at: one, she in the pale green muslin, is so lovely
that it takes one&#39;s breath; like a dark lily, with her
pale clear skin, her shadowy hair and eyes, her bending
grace and languor. The other contrasts with her
prettily enough: a tall, powerful young creature, vigor
in every line of her, color flashing in her red-gold
hair, in her dark blue eyes, in the shell-pink of her
cheeks. She is in white, as befits her; this type
should wear white always. A white dimity gown,
made with absolute simplicity, this again contrasting
with the green muslin, which is flounced and ruffled
and lace-trimmed, as if the lily had clad herself in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page2" id="page2"></a>[pg&nbsp;2]</span>
fronds of the lady fern. The two are talking earnestly
together, their eyes on the shouting children.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, Eleanor! no! you are wrong. Kitty shall
know nothing, if I can help it, but what is lovely.
Think of St. Paul: &#39;Whatsoever things are pure,
whatsoever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of
good report; if there be any virtue, and if there be any
praise, think on these things.&#39; My Kitty shall think
on these things, and on nothing else.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very well, my dear! but that will never do for my
Tom. He must worship the God of things as they
are. The public school for Tommy, the very minute
he strikes six! He must rub shoulders with the ashman&#39;s
children, the washerwoman&#39;s, the&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Eleanor!</i> Kitty shall never know that the washerwoman
<i>has</i> any children! She shall not <i>touch</i>, if I
can help it, anything that is rude or squalid or ugly.
No, no! My little flower shall be &#39;a gentlewoman of
high quality&#39;! And she shall marry the Duke of Lee,
and go to the King&#39;s levee, or at least to the President&#39;s.
I don&#39;t dare to say, you fierce republican, that I wish
we had a King! Come here, Kitty my Pretty, and
dance the &#39;Duke of Lee&#39; with Tommy! He shall be
the duke&mdash;you&#39;d love to be a duke, wouldn&#39;t you,
Tommy? See! now Kitty is a gentlewoman of high
quality, and she picks up her petticoats&mdash;pick them up,
Kitty!&mdash;and you make a low bow, so! left hand on
your heart, Tom, right hand on your sword&mdash;so! Now
dance, while I sing!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The boy is perhaps eight years old, the girl six.
Here, too, is contrast; Tommy Lee, a sturdy, square-shouldered,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page3" id="page3"></a>[pg&nbsp;3]</span>
rosy urchin, Kitty Ross a slender windflower
of a child, with all her mother&#39;s lissome grace,
but with the fair hair and steady gray eyes of her
father. They are both on the pony digging their heels
into his side and shouting to him to &quot;Go on! go <i>won</i>,
Rosy Nanty!&quot; Rosinante meanwhile, standing firm,
revolving in his mind whether to rub them off gently
against the fence, or to lie down and make believe go
to sleep. They are his second generation of children;
he knows all about them.</p>

<p class="indent">At the call, they slide down and come running.
Everybody does what Mary Ross bids. Readily
enough they take place opposite each other: they often
dance together. Tom is a bit clumsy, but Kitty has
grace enough for two, her mother thinks; indeed, so
does Tom&#39;s mother. Now Mary Ross, leaning forward,
claps her hands, and begins to sing:</p>

What if&mdash;oh, Eleanor, dear!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The little creatures dance sedately, tiptoeing here,
pirouetting there. The young mothers clap their hands
in time to the quaint, old-world tune. The pony
stamps and whinnies, rather vexed at being left out
of the fun after all. The June sun, shining through
the linden branches, thinks, perhaps, that he has seen
nothing prettier that day, nor for many days.</p>

<p class="indent">Dance, little Duke! Dance, fairy Duchess! Sing
and clap your hands, sweet, dark lily-lady! It is June,
in the world and in your hearts; dance and sing while
yet you may!</p>

<p class="indent">To understand this story, you must know something
of the topography of Cyrus, which is like
no other town in the State. (But every town
says that of itself!)</p>

<p class="indent">In the middle is the Common; square, green, with
intersecting gravel paths, each with its marshaled rows
of maples, which in summer are just trees, but in
autumn turn to bowers and towers of scarlet and gold.
On one side of the Common are the Churches, Congregational
and Baptist; on two others the Houses,
whereof anon; the fourth side, that fronting west,
is mostly occupied by the Mallow House, where Mr.
Marshall Mallow reigns as king and landlord. Under
the hill runs the Street proper, where are the
&quot;stores&quot;: Abram Hanks&#39;s, where you may buy everything
from pins to poplin, from buttons to bonnet wire;
the general store, kept by Orison and Aquila
Wesley&mdash;peace to their memory! they are gone now,
but one never forgets the large sign which gave their
names in full, black on white, spelled over in wonder
by generations of children; the &quot;bookstore&quot;&mdash;how
proud we were of having a bookstore! Tinkham had
none, nor Tupham. There were not many books in it,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page6" id="page6"></a>[pg&nbsp;6]</span>
it is true; a selection of fifty-cent novels, chosen (it
was always supposed) by Miss Almeria Bygood for
their &quot;tone.&quot; Parents were perfectly safe in buying
a book for their children at Bygood&#39;s; &quot;Bygones,&quot;
Cissy Sharpe called them; some of the novels, the
shopworn ones, were let out at two cents a day. My
first novel, &quot;John Halifax,&quot; came from Bygood&#39;s; I
read &quot;St. Elmo,&quot; too, and &quot;Queechy,&quot; and learned
from the latter that a heroine may weep on every page
of two hundred and be none the worse for it. Mr.
Bygood was very old even when I first remember
him. He sat mostly in the back shop, reading the
<i>Farmers&#39; Almanac</i>; a venerable figure in a black frock
coat with a high dickey. His blue eyes were full of
kindness. If a child of his acquaintance (and what
child was not?) came in to buy a paper or get a library
book, he would utter a gentle bellow. Then Miss
Almeria or Miss Egeria would give one a little push
and say, &quot;Go on, dear! Father wants to pass the time
of day with you!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">One was not clear in one&#39;s mind as to what passing
the time of day meant, but one went, and shook
hands with Mr. Bygood&mdash;rather dreadful, this, because
his hand shook, and the joints had chalk swellings&mdash;and
said one was very well, thank you, and so
was Father, and so was Mother. Then Mr. Bygood
would say, &quot;Do you mind your book, my dear? Always
mind your book! Remember Goody Twoshoes!&quot;
The first part of this address was also puzzling, for
to &quot;mind&quot; meant, in our vocabulary, <i>A</i>, to obey, as
one&#39;s parents and elders, <i>B</i>, to dislike, as spiders and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page7" id="page7"></a>[pg&nbsp;7]</span>
large, smooth green caterpillars. (We were told that
they were Beautiful Works of Nature, but we knew
better!) However, when we came to Goody Twoshoes,
we were on safe ground, and could say heartily
and sincerely, &quot;Please show me, Mr. Bygood!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then Mr. Bygood&#39;s mild blue eyes would brighten,
and he would open a queer old desk and take out a
queer little old book&mdash;<i>very</i> old, for he had had it
when he was a little boy, he said&mdash;only one could
hardly think printing was invented then!&mdash;and read
aloud in his high quavering voice the immortal tale
of the little school mistress.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nothing could have supported little Margery under
the affliction she was in for the loss of her brother
but the pleasure she took in her two shoes. She ran
to Mrs. Smith as soon as they were put on, and stroking
down her ragged apron, cried out: &#39;Two Shoes,
Ma&#39;am; see Two Shoes!&#39; And so she behaved to all
the people she met, and by that means obtained the
name of Little Goody Twoshoes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">This was for little girls. Mr. Bygood did not care
much for boys as a rule; but when Tom Lee came in
he always produced &quot;Marmaduke Multiply,&quot; which
was even older than Goody Twoshoes, and read to
him from that. Dear Mr. Bygood! how kind he was!
He had peppermints, too, sometimes, but I fear we
were not always grateful for these: they were apt to
be fuzzy, from carrying in his blue cotton handkerchief;
and besides, was not Cheeseman&#39;s next door?
But we have not come to Cheeseman&#39;s yet.</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Almeria and Miss Egeria kept the shop, sold
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page8" id="page8"></a>[pg&nbsp;8]</span>
the daily paper (that came from Tinkham; Tinkham
was larger, we had to admit that, though otherwise&mdash;well,
no matter!) and the <i>Cyrus Centinel</i>, our own
weekly; besides pens and paper and the above-described
books. They were dear ladies, Miss Almeria and
Miss Egeria: we loved them both, and much of the romance
of old-time Cyrus&mdash;long before our own time,
Kitty Ross&#39;s and mine&mdash;clustered about them. Miss
Almeria was tall and handsome, with jet-black hair
and eyes of brilliant Irish blue. She had a fine figure
and great dignity, yet her laugh was as merry as
Kitty&#39;s own. Apparently, half Cyrus had wanted to
marry Miss Almeria: it was matter of common knowledge
that Mr. Mallow had asked her five times, and
Mr. Jordano three. Hannah Sullivan, who did our
chores and waited at our parties, was a warm partisan
of Mr. Mallow&#39;s, and could never meet Miss Almeria
without crying, &quot;He&#39;ll die but he&#39;ll have ye!&quot; Mr.
Mallow did not look as if he would die, but one never
could tell.</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Egeria was gentle and quiet, a still brook
where her sister was a flashing rapid. She had her
father&#39;s mild eyes and kind, hesitating way. She
never seemed quite sure of anything, dear Miss Egeria,
but would always appeal to her sister. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t
wonder but it rained to-morrow, would you, Almy?&quot;
And if Miss Almeria said crisply, &quot;Nonsense, Gerie!
there isn&#39;t a cloud in the sky,&quot; Miss Egeria would nod
her curls with a gentle, &quot;I wouldn&#39;t wonder if &#39;twas
pleasant, after all!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Egeria, if not such a belle as Miss Almeria,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page9" id="page9"></a>[pg&nbsp;9]</span>
had yet had her admirers. We all knew that the two
gentlemen disrespectfully known as &quot;Twinnies&quot; had
loved Miss Egeria and her alone, the greater part
of their meek lives. They were not twins, not even
brothers; but cousins and closest friends, Mr. Jason
and Mr. Josiah Jebus. They kept the Crewel Shop:
it had been opened under that name during the last
craze for crewel work in the seventies, and had never
changed. As Mr. Jason said, if they changed with
every turn of fashion in fancy work, where would
they be?</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why not call it the Fancy Shop once for all, and
stick to that?&quot; Kitty Ross asked him once; but Mr.
Jason shook his head. &quot;That would sound frivolous,
Katharine!&quot; he said. &quot;Josiah and I are not frivolous!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They were not. They carried on their funny little
business with a gravity and decorum that was all their
own. Mr. Jason, as a rule, did the selling, matched
the worsteds and yarns, advised the selection of patterns.
Mr. Josiah embroidered. He had a club foot,
and walked very lame, but his fingers were wonderfully
nimble; we loved to watch him, as seated at his
embroidery frame, half hidden by the green rep curtain
which divided the front shop from the back (the
latter was their living room), he sent his needle flying
back and forth with what seemed to us miraculous
speed.</p>

<p class="indent">The Crewel Shop was a tiny building, tucked in
between Adams&#39;s and the Mallow House. A minute
kitchen behind the back-shop-sitting-room, a bedroom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page10" id="page10"></a>[pg&nbsp;10]</span>
above:&mdash;that was all, but it was enough for the little
gentlemen. They never wanted to lose sight of each
other; they had only one opinion between them on any
subject. In this they differed from the Miss Bygoods.
They did not appeal to each other; they simply said,
&quot;We think it will rain to-morrow.&quot; This was carried
so far that one or the other might be heard, in &quot;grippy&quot;
weather, to say, &quot;We have a cold!&quot; and Cissy Sharpe
insisted&mdash;but one did not always believe Cissy implicitly&mdash;that
that she had seen Mr. Jason on several occasions
try to walk lame like Mr. Josiah.</p>

<p class="indent">This being so, it was no more than natural that
both gentlemen should have loved the same lady. Our
theory (a knot of school girls gossiping over their
noonday buns and pickled limes, we had a theory to
fit everything in town) was that they had never told
their love, for fear of interfering with each other. If
this was true, it might have been hard on Miss Egeria,
supposing her to have cared for either; but we somehow
doubted if she ever had. They were so very
mild, and their wigs (exactly alike, and dressed every
month by Mr. Beard the barber&mdash;so appropriately
named, we thought!) were such a peculiar shade of
pinkish brown, and so palpably made of jute!</p>

<p class="indent">My mother, who detested gossip, put an end one
fine day to all our romancing about still-remaining possibilities
for &quot;Miss Bygoods&quot; by telling us the simple
truth; that the dear ladies had both lost their lovers in
the Civil War, and had never thought of matrimony
since. She added that Kitty and I were a pair of silly
girls, and would much better study our algebra lesson
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page11" id="page11"></a>[pg&nbsp;11]</span>
than gossip about people who presumably knew their
own affairs; Kitty and I went off with hanging heads,
but more imbued than ever with sentimental melancholy.</p>

<p class="indent">We couldn&#39;t help it, we agreed: Cyrus certainly <i>was</i>
a romantic place. There were so many interesting people;
so many curious names! Mr. Very Jordano! How
could a man be named Very Jordano and not be romantic?
His mother was a Miss Very, but his father
was&mdash;<i>must</i> be&mdash;of Italian descent. Look at Mr. Jordano&#39;s
hair, and eyes, and the way he wore that picturesque
cloak, such as no one else in Cyrus would
ever think of wearing. Mr. Jordano had no objection
to our looking at his hair and eyes and cloak: his Italian
aspect was his joy and pride, and he cultivated it
sedulously. &quot;A poor scribbler!&quot; he was wont to say
of himself. &quot;A poor country editor, sir; but in my
veins flows the blood of&mdash;h&#39;m! ha! <i>nimporto!</i>&quot; and
then he would glance over his shoulder mysteriously,
as if to see whether he was being followed, and curl
his long mustache, and hum &quot;Santa Lucia&quot; as fiercely
as that plaintive air can be hummed. He edited the
<i>Centinel</i>, as I have said, and signed his own articles
&quot;Italio.&quot; When, as sometimes happened, his spelling
of <i>Centinel</i> was criticized, he would say: &quot;It is the
spelling used by Sir Walter Scott, sir! what is good
enough for the Wizard of the North is good enough
for me&mdash;tee! tee!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">I have left Cheeseman&#39;s till the last, but it was first
in our hearts and our thoughts. Mr. Ivory Cheeseman&#39;s
candy shop and kitchen was the delight and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page12" id="page12"></a>[pg&nbsp;12]</span>
the despair of every child in Cyrus. We knew to a
nicety the day each kind of candy was made. Monday
was peppermint day, Tuesday was devoted to
caramels, Wednesday to sticks, Thursday to drops, and
so on. We timed our visits accordingly, and I fear
we were shameless little beggars, for though we
clutched our legitimate &quot;nickel&quot; tight, prepared to surrender
it when we had made our choice, we knew
very well that if we were &quot;pretty-behaved,&quot; Uncle
Ivory would probably ask us to taste those lemon drops
or to see if that batch of cream ribbon wasn&#39;t a little
mite better than common. Dear Uncle Ivory! how we
loved him, spite of the sharp tongue that was the terror
of &quot;slack&quot; or unmannerly children!</p>

<p class="indent">But this will never do. I am wandering all about
Cyrus, shaking hands with everybody&mdash;I wish I could!&mdash;as
if I still lived there, as if this were my own story;
whereas, it is the story of Kitty Ross, and it is high
time that I brought her in properly, instead of letting
her whisk round an occasional corner, as she has
hitherto been doing.</p>

<p class="indent">The story begins with Kitty&#39;s return to Cyrus after
her mother&#39;s death. Her father had died two years
before. Mrs. Ross&mdash;the gay, lovely, flower-like little
lady, who had never felt a rough wind while he lived&mdash;could
not stay long after him. She and Kitty went
abroad, and wandered about here and there. Then
came the panic, and most of the comfortable property
Dr. Ross had left was swept away, I am not clear just
how. Very little was left, and much of that little was
invested in western railroads that paid no dividends. I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page13" id="page13"></a>[pg&nbsp;13]</span>
will hurry over this part. Mrs. Ross drooped like a
broken flower; drooped and died, and Kitty was left
alone.</p>

<p class="indent">If Tom Lee had been at home that year, this story
would never have been written; but Tom was in China,
building railways. So Kitty came back alone to Cyrus,
where she was born and bred. Cyrus people are the
kindest in the world, I believe. They may be fond of
gossip (I don&#39;t find that a thousand miles away it is
less popular) and they may be a trifle stiff-necked, like
their Puritan ancestors before them, but kind they certainly
are. Ever since the news of Mrs. Ross&#39;s death
came, Cyrus had been asking, what <i>would</i> Kitty do?
The money was gone, practically gone, Judge Peters
said. There was enough for her clothes and fal-lals, but
little more, sir, little more. Something must be
thought of. Some&mdash;thing&mdash;must&mdash;be&mdash;thought&mdash;of.
The judge looked and spoke cheerfully, because he
had already thought of something. He was Dr. Ross&#39;s
executor, and who had a better right, he would like to
know?</p>

<p class="indent">The Miss Bygoods, talking together in low tones,
while Father nodded over the fire, voiced the same sentiment.
The dear child! they said. Of course she
could not stay in that great house alone, even with
Sarepta. Sarepta was good and faithful, of course,
and an excellent cook, as everyone knew; but she was
no companion for Kitty, even if her temper were not&mdash;well,
uncertain.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think the little blue room, Sister!&quot; said Miss
Almeria. &quot;There are bluebirds on the paper, you know,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page14" id="page14"></a>[pg&nbsp;14]</span>
and Kitty always made me think of a bluebird. Dear
me! how pleasant to think of having a young creature
in the house again!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And oh, sister!&quot; Miss Egeria beamed softly over
her tatting. &quot;We can give her a little Society! Nothing
elaborate, of course, only ice-cream and sponge-drops,
but&mdash;wandering about the Continent as she has been&mdash;not
that I mean a word in criticism of dear, sainted
Mrs. Ross; no, indeed! but to meet Cyrus people, and
have a little social life, will mean a great deal to dear
Kitty. I mean when she puts on half mourning, of
course.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Almeria pondered.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wish there were more young people!&quot; she said.
&quot;There is no better society than that of Cyrus, but&mdash;but
we must acknowledge that most of our agreeable
people are&mdash;a&mdash;mature, and Kitty is so young!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There is Wilson Wibird;&quot; Miss Egeria spoke timidly.
&quot;Wilson is young.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Almeria looked grave.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wilson is young!&quot; she acknowledged with a dignified
bend of her handsome head. &quot;I fear there is
little more to be said in his favor.&quot; She paused. Wilson
Wibird had been in Egeria&#39;s Sunday School class,
and she could not bear to think ill of him. Why give
pain? thought Miss Almeria.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I cannot think that Kitty would find him interesting!&quot;
she concluded.</p>

<p class="indent">Interesting, indeed! Miss Almeria had never heard
Wilson Wibird shrieking from the gutter, &quot;Ma! Ma!
Kitty Ross knocked me down and trompled on me!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page15" id="page15"></a>[pg&nbsp;15]</span>
&quot;And there are the Chanters!&quot; Miss Egeria spoke
more confidently, as Miss Almeria&#39;s face lightened.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, there are the Chanters. They will be pleasant
playmates for Kitty: they are young, and gay: I almost
think&mdash;I fear&mdash;Zephine and Rodney may sometimes
be a little <i>too</i> gay, sister, but perhaps not. Yes, the
Chanters will certainly be a resource; still, my dear, we
must acknowledge that there have been great changes
in Cyrus. It is not what it was in our youth.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">And Miss Egeria did acknowledge it meekly.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Marshall Mallow, at the Mallow House, made a
careful examination of his rooms about this time;
studying wall-papers, carpets and decorations, with
meticulous care. One room, he decided, a pleasant
corner room, facing south and west, could do with a
new paper, and one or two nice &quot;edgin&#39;s.&quot; &quot;I don&#39;t
care for these chromios,&quot; he said to Billy. (Billy was
his clerk: if he had another name, I never knew it.)
&quot;They&#39;re too glarish. Give me a good edgin&#39; or engravement!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Mallow&#39;s English was all his own, but nobody
minded, because he never said anything unkind in it.
He overflowed with warmth, like the rising sun, which,
indeed, he somewhat resembled, with <i>his</i> round, rosy
face and polished head. He inherited the Mallow House
from his father, who in turn had taken it from <i>his</i>
father, who built it. It was a family affair. Since
old Mrs. Mallow died, Mr. Marshall (known as
&quot;Marsh&quot; among his intimates) had been his own
housekeeper, major-domo and butler. &quot;I don&#39;t want
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page16" id="page16"></a>[pg&nbsp;16]</span>
no woman gormineerin&#39; over me!&quot; he often said; but
this was when youth was past, and with it all hope of
Miss Almeria; or so we girls maintained.</p>

<p class="indent">The boarders at the Mallow House&mdash;but here I go
wandering again. The boarders must wait.</p>

<p class="h2">CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="smcap">enter kitty</span></p>

<p class="indent">Judge Peters, tall and spare, in glossy frock
coat and tall hat, met Kitty at the station. Miss
Almeria Bygood was there, too, and Mr. Mallow.
It was quite a getherin&#39;, the latter said: quite
a getherin&#39;. Gen&#39;lly, he despised to see folks conjugating
round the deepo, but this was an occasion, you
see.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Very Jordano, notebook in hand, keeping a
sharp lookout for the train, agreed with him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I expect Miss Kitty will be a distang young
lady!&quot; he said. &quot;Traveled the world around; the
world around. A select gathering is surely appropriate-tate-tate!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It must not be supposed that Cyrus was a place of
individual dialects. Most of us spoke ordinary English
or good, strong, racy Yankee; it was only these two
gentlemen who were peculiar in their speech. Mr.
Jordano had formerly had an impediment; was, in
fact, a confirmed stutterer, till he came to man&#39;s estate.
The story went that one day, wishing to go to
Tupham, he found himself wholly unable to ask for a
ticket. He stood before the friendly station master,
gasping, scarlet, but uttering no sound.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page18" id="page18"></a>[pg&nbsp;18]</span>
&quot;Come, Very!&quot; said Mr. Tosh. &quot;Put a name to it!
Where do you want to go? Train&#39;s due!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;T-T-T-&quot; stammered Mr. Very, &quot;T-T-T-<i>Damn it!
I&#39;ll walk to Tupham!</i>&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">After this experience, he set himself, carefully and
methodically, to remedy the defect: labored, suffered,
finally conquered. I know not what his method was:
I only know that he was apt to repeat the final syllable
of a word, sometimes with singular effect. When he
said, &quot;Business is looking up-pup-pup,&quot; or &quot;I fear
I must be going now-wow-wow!&quot; strangers were surprised.
To us, it was as much a part of Mr. Jordano
as his foreign idioms; foreign idiocies, Mrs. Sharpe
called them. These were simply an assertion of his
Italian descent. Nothing vexed him so much as to be
addressed as &quot;Jordan,&quot; a thing that happened now and
then. &quot;Names ending in O,&quot; he would say, &quot;are invariably
of Latin origin, Latin origin-gin-gin!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He set great store by the letter &quot;O,&quot; and seemed to
think that it could not fail to impart a Latin tinge
to whatever word it adorned. His favorite exclamation,
&quot;Nimporto!&quot; (pronounced as spelled) was an
example of his method, if it could be called a method.
He knew little of French vowel sounds, nothing of
accents; <i>i</i> was English <i>i</i> to him, long or short as might
be, except when it was mysteriously <i>a</i>. <i>Distingué</i> was
&quot;distang,&quot; and so on. It is unlikely that he was acquainted
with Mrs. Plornish, as he thought Dickens
unrefined, and never read him; but his epithets sometimes
rivaled those of that immortal lady.</p>

<p class="indent">Here is the train, and here is&mdash;a fine lady? a flounced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page19" id="page19"></a>[pg&nbsp;19]</span>
and furbelowed Frenchwoman, as Mrs. Sharpe predicted?
No! just Kitty! our own Kitty, rather pale,
rather larger-eyed than usual (which was unreasonable!)
sweet and simple in her dark gray dress.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very distang!&quot; murmured Mr. Jordano, making
a series of little bows over his note-book. &quot;Oh, very
distang, indeed!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Kitty! my dear child!&quot; Miss Almeria had her in
her arms, and the fair head drooped a moment on that
kind black satin shoulder; but only for a moment; then
Kitty was herself again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dear Miss Almeria! how perfectly <i>darling</i> of you!
Oh, Judge! Oh, Mr. Mallow, I <i>am</i> so glad to see you!
And oh! if it isn&#39;t Mr. Jordano! How d&#39;ye do, Mr.
Jordano? Did you come to meet me, too? I do think
you are the kindest people in the world! Oh, Judge,
I&#39;ve come home! I&#39;ve come home!&quot;</p>

<div class="image-center" style="max-width: 500px;">
<a name="illus02" id="illus02"></a>
<img class="border" src="images/illus02.jpg" width="500" height="700" alt="" />
<div class="caption">
<p class="center">&quot;Oh, Judge, I&#39;ve come home! I&#39;ve come home!&quot;</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">Kitty&#39;s voice quavered, and the tears came into her
gray eyes, but she winked them away resolutely. Judge
Peters blew his nose with a long, sonorous note. He
had had a little speech of welcome all ready in the back
of his head; nothing formal, just distinctive enough to
mark the occasion; but all he found to say, and that
gruffly, without an atom of his beautiful Court manner,
was: &quot;How are you, Kitty? How are you? Glad
to see you!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Jordano was hardly more fortunate, even
though he had written down his remarks the night before,
and committed them to memory while shaving
that morning. But he began bravely:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Miss Kitty, I bid you welcome to your native
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page20" id="page20"></a>[pg&nbsp;20]</span>
heath! This day&mdash;a&mdash;every inhabitant of Cyrus&mdash;a&mdash;will
be marked with a white letter and a red stone&mdash;I&mdash;I
would say a red letter and a white stone-tone-tone.
The Graces&mdash;a&mdash;the Muses&mdash;&mdash;&quot; Mr. Jordano hesitated
and was lost. &quot;Nimporto!&quot; he said hastily. &quot;I
am glad to see you, Miss Kitty; you are looking well,
my dear young lady, considering everything-ting-ting!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Jordano retired in confusion, flourishing his
note-book nervously. Mr. Mallow&#39;s turn had come.
Taking both Kitty&#39;s hands, he shook them up and down
solemnly, as if working a double pump.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How are you, Kitty?&quot; he said huskily. &quot;Pretty
well, thank ye! My bronical tubes don&#39;t conjingle,
that&#39;s all. Well! well! well! how about it? Lots of
water in the &#39;Tlantic Ocean, eh? Treat you pretty
well, did they? Find anything better than the Mallow
House in them foreign caravans? Bet you didn&#39;t!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Here the Chanters swept round the corner, rosy,
breathless, shouting, &quot;Late, as usual!&quot; and the reception
was over. There could be no ceremony where
the Chanters were. The three girls enveloped Kitty in
exclamatory embraces: the three boys (well-grown
youths, but always boys!) hovered about, as nearly
embarrassed as Chanters could be, cracking their finger-joints
and getting in a word when they could. It
was something like this:</p>

<p class="indent">Trebles: &quot;You dear, darling, delicious <i>Thing!</i> It <i>is</i>
too simply heavenly to get you back! Oh, Kitty, it <i>is</i>
so rapturous!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Basses: &quot;Great, Kitty! awf&#39;lly glad!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page21" id="page21"></a>[pg&nbsp;21]</span>
Trebles: &quot;My <i>dear</i>, I can&#39;t believe it is you, though
you <i>do</i> look so deliciously natural, you darling!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Basses: &quot;Corking, Kitty! looking awf&#39;lly well!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Trebles: &quot;<i>Isn&#39;t</i> she? Only a <i>scrap</i> shadowy, but it
makes her eyes all the bigger. <i>Kitty!</i> They are a mile
round at <i>least</i>! I never saw&mdash;Oh, you <i>precious</i> Thing,
I <i>must</i> kiss you again! Won&#39;t you give the boys just
<i>one</i>&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Basses: &quot;Oh! I say!&quot; <i>Exeunt</i>, blushing peony red.</p>

<p class="indent">It had been decided that Nelly Chanter should have
tea that first night with Kitty. Miss Egeria Bygood
had held an anxious consultation with Sarepta, the
Ruler of Ross House. Miss Bygoods had hoped to
have Kitty at their house this first evening; Miss
Egeria advanced the proposition rather tremulously.
What did Sarepta think? It would be <i>such</i> a pleasure
to Father: Kitty had always been his favorite: there
happened to be a sweetbread in the house&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">Sarepta fixed her with an inscrutable pale blue eye.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No&#39;m! thankin&#39; you all the same, but it can&#39;t be
done. She&#39;s best off in her own home at the first of
it. I&#39;ve got everything provided. But it&#39;s real kind
of you!&quot; she added, relenting. &quot;I&#39;ll tell her you asked
her, and she&#39;ll be just as pleased.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh!&quot; Miss Egeria had been making little plaintive
sounds, like a deprecating bird. &quot;But do you think,
Sarepta&mdash;won&#39;t it be sad for the dear child, all alone&mdash;not
that you are not excellent company, Sarepta!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ask Nelly Chanter!&quot; Sarepta evidently had it all
arranged in her mind. &quot;I was goin&#39; to send word to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page22" id="page22"></a>[pg&nbsp;22]</span>
her, but if you would! She has the most sense of any
of &#39;em. And she&#39;s young!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Sarepta did not mean to be cruel, but the thing must
be understood. It was understood: Miss Egeria bowed
her head meekly.</p>

<p class="indent">John Tucker had waited till the first rush of Chanters
was over. He now advanced quietly, and touching
his hat with a twinkle of welcome, took possession
of Kitty&#39;s bag.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Glad to see you, Miss Kitty!&quot; he said. &quot;The checks,
Miss? I&#39;ll see to your trunks. Pilot&#39;s round the corner.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, John!&quot; Kitty&#39;s face broke into a wholly new
combination of smiles. &quot;Shake hands, John! Aren&#39;t
you glad to see me? Oh, I am <i>so</i> glad to see you!
How&#39;s Mary? And the children? Sarepta is well, of
course! She wouldn&#39;t dare to be anything else, with
me coming home: not that she ever was!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Now, how exactly like John Tucker! All in a
moment, with no word, with hardly a look, he had got
Kitty away from the eager group of friends, each of
whom was waiting for a little private word with her;
had tucked her into the sleigh, given the checks to the
expressman (who had rather hoped he might get a
word and a glance, too), chirruped to Pilot, and
whisked round the corner out of sight. Exactly like
John Tucker!</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How mean of John!&quot; cried Zephine Chanter.
&quot;Why, I hadn&#39;t time to see her dress, or anything!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;John Tucker&#39;s movements are quick-wick-wick!&quot;
said Mr. Jordano. &quot;We may as well be jogging, neighbors.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page23" id="page23"></a>[pg&nbsp;23]</span>
Miss Almeria, may I accommodate my steps to
yours as far as the corner?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The little group dispersed, Miss Bygood and Mr.
Jordano departing first, a stately pair.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Aren&#39;t they <i>too</i> delicious?&quot; demanded Zephine
Chanter, looking after them. &quot;Don&#39;t you think they
might hit it off after all, Lina? Hannah Sullivan
says he&#39;ll die but he&#39;ll have her!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hannah Sullivan has said that of Mr. Mallow
for twenty-five years, mother says!&quot; Lina, the eldest
and quietest of the Chanters, spoke reprovingly, &quot;and&mdash;and
I wouldn&#39;t, Zephine, if I were you!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know you wouldn&#39;t, Sobersides dear; but I would,
you see! Where&#39;s Nelly? Nell, mind you notice every
stitch she has on. <i>Disgusting</i> of Sarepta to ask you
instead of me&mdash;but perfectly right, you darling thing!
Come on, girls! The boys have gone. Weren&#39;t they
<i>too</i> craven! when, of course, they were dying to!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Speeding along the level, jogging up the hill, John
Tucker kept his eyes fixed steadily between Pilot&#39;s
sharp-pricked ears, and kept up a steady stream of
cheerful talk which enabled Kitty to cry quietly into
her muff and no harm done. Yes, they was all well,
he guessed. Mary had had one of them spells last
summer, but she was rugged now, and the children similar.
Sarepty was in her usual health, fur as he knew:
he never knew anything to ail Sarepty. He didn&#39;t
know but &#39;twas because she was so poor of flesh:
nothin&#39; for sickness to take holt of, or so it appeared.
Bones wasn&#39;t liable to ail any, he guessed. What
say?</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page24" id="page24"></a>[pg&nbsp;24]</span>
&quot;John Tucker, how you talk!&quot; Kitty was actually
laughing, a quavering little laugh, but still&mdash;&quot;As if
bones didn&#39;t ache when people have rheumatism! Dear
me! how is old Mrs. Tosh, John?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I couldn&#39;t say, Miss Kitty; that is, not precisely.
She ain&#39;t livin&#39;, Mis&#39; Tosh ain&#39;t&mdash;at the present time!&quot;
John added gravely, with an air of guarding his words
carefully. &quot;She passed away&mdash;yes&#39;m! &#39;Twas about
the time we lost old Victory.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is Victory dead? Oh, John! the dear old horse!
Why, she was the first horse I ever drove. Don&#39;t you
remember Father giving me the reins, and dear Mother
being so frightened?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do, Miss!&quot; John Tucker&#39;s face, which had been
carefully wooden till now, broke into curiously carved
wrinkles of laughter. &quot;I&#39;ll remember that, I guess,
long as I remember anything. Little tyke you was&mdash;excuse
me, Miss Kitty!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I certainly was! go on, John!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Six years old, warn&#39;t you? Or not more&#39;n seven
anyhow. &#39;You may drive round to the stable, Daughterkin!&#39;
says Doctor, and puts the reins in your little
mites of hands. &#39;Yes, Doctor,&#39; says you. &#39;I&#39;ll drive
round!&#39; and you took them reins, and before any one
could so much as wink, you was out of the yard, cuttin&#39;
down the ro&#39;d full chisel&mdash;gee whiminy! I can
see you now. Your Ma hollered right out, and I don&#39;t
wonder, fraygile as she was. I know it took <i>my</i> breath
away. Why, I never see anything go so quick. It
appeared like you and Victory had got it fixed up between
you, so to speak. Doctor himself was took
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page25" id="page25"></a>[pg&nbsp;25]</span>
aback, I could see that, the way he winked his eyes,
but he wouldn&#39;t let on.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Don&#39;t be frightened, Mary,&#39; he says. &#39;The little
imp has a good grip, and Victory is as kind as kindness!&#39;
he says. All the same, I noticed he was lookin&#39;
pretty sharp up the ro&#39;d! And when he see the old
mare&#39;s nose come round the corner, gee whiminy! he
slaps his leg and hollers out, &#39;A daughter of Jehu!&#39; he
says, quotin&#39; Scriptur&#39;, I believe, the way he did. &#39;A
daughter of Jehu, for behold she driveth furiously!&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Kitty was laughing outright now.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dear Papa! I <i>was</i> a little imp, wasn&#39;t I, John?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, Miss, you sure was. But yet&mdash;&quot; John Tucker,
cocking his head argumentatively, ventured for the
first time to look at his companion, saw her face firm
and cheerful, and went on with confidence&mdash;&quot;but yet
you knew what you was about well enough. You&#39;d
ben handlin&#39; the ribbons a year or more goin&#39; to and
from the stable, &#39;longside o&#39; me or your Pa: you was
tough as hickory, and you was knowledgeable: there
warn&#39;t nothing to be scared of. &#39;A daughter of Jehu!&#39;
says Doctor, &#39;for behold she driveth furiously. Here
she comes, Mary! she&#39;s all right!&#39; He laughed right
out, and then he pulls his face straight, and looks
mighty solemn, and you come lickety-split along the
ro&#39;d and turned in the gate as neat as a whistle, and
pulls up front the door. I says to myself, &#39;Wal!&#39; I
says; &#39;that young one,&#39; I says, &#39;is all right!&#39; And so
it has proved.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nice John! Thank you, John! And we&#39;ve been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page26" id="page26"></a>[pg&nbsp;26]</span>
friends ever since, haven&#39;t we? But Papa scolded me,
didn&#39;t he?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He did, Miss. &#39;You little imp,&#39; he says, &#39;I told
you to drive round to the stable!&#39; &#39;Yes, Papa dear,&#39; you
says: I can hear you now. &#39;So I did, dear Papa; round
the square!&#39; He had to laugh then, would he or
wouldn&#39;t he!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Victory could have made just as good a turn without
me!&quot; said honest Kitty. &quot;She was as wise as
three ordinary horses; and she knew the way round
that turn as well as the way into her own stall. She
was pretty old even then, John, wasn&#39;t she?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Victory,&quot; said John Tucker, slowly, &quot;was thirty-five
years old when she died this spring. I set out
to write you, but I couldn&#39;t seem to. Kind o&#39; broke me
up, losin&#39; her. She was the first hoss ever I come to
know and care for. Lemme see! I come to work for
Doctor thirty years ago this winter. Victory was five
years old, and she was a pictur! prettiest hoss I ever
see, bar none. Well! now you might be&mdash;?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Twenty!&quot; said Kitty.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s right! And Vict&#39;ry was twenty that time
you driv her round the square. She kep&#39; smart right
along up to the last week, old mare did: I didn&#39;t
drive her any last summer, only once in a while, so&#39;s
her feelin&#39;s wouldn&#39;t be hurt, seein&#39; the other hosses
go out. She&#39;d whinny out just as <i>askin&#39;</i>! &#39;Why ain&#39;t
I goin&#39; out?&#39; she&#39;d say, plain as any person need to
speak. Then I&#39;d put her in the light sulky and drive
her up and down the ro&#39;d a piece, and she&#39;d antic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page27" id="page27"></a>[pg&nbsp;27]</span>
round and toss up her head as if she was the President&#39;s
wife goin&#39; to meetin&#39;.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I hope she didn&#39;t suffer, John?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No&#39;m! no! she died like a Christian, the old mare
did. One night she wouldn&#39;t take her sugar; I allers
gave her the sugar, like you told me, Miss Kitty&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dear, good John! Thank you, John!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So I suspicioned what was comin&#39;, seein&#39; her age
and all. I told S&#39;repty, and she brung out an extry
good mash, but &#39;twas no use. Old mare laid down,
and we set there with her. She looked at me real
lovin&#39;, and put her nose in my hand, and I rubbed her,
and S&#39;repty rubbed her; and &#39;long about ten o&#39;clock she
just stretched out and passed away, same as if she was
a person.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">John Tucker cleared his throat and was silent for a
few minutes; then he addressed Pilot, his present joy
and pride, with some asperity:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Git ap, you! No reason for <i>your</i> goin&#39; to sleep that
I know of. Miss Kitty&mdash;&quot; he glanced sidelong at his
companion&mdash;&quot;the ro&#39;d&#39;s first rate here on the level. I
didn&#39;t know but you might like to drive a spell&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, John!&quot; Kitty looked down ruefully at the gray
suède gloves which had seemed just the right thing
for traveling. Pilot had a pretty solid mouth. &quot;If I
only had some decent gloves!&quot; she sighed.</p>

<p class="indent">With a sheepish look, John Tucker fumbled in an
outside pocket and pulled out a stout pair of leather
gloves, fur-lined.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;S&#39;repty wouldn&#39;t give &#39;em to me!&quot; he chuckled;
&quot;but I remembered the drawer where you kep&#39; &#39;em.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page28" id="page28"></a>[pg&nbsp;28]</span>
You&#39;ll need &#39;em. I kep&#39; him in yes&#39;day a-puppose.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">With a flashing, &quot;Oh, John! You <i>are</i> a darling!&quot;
Kitty almost snatched the gloves from him. Another
moment, and they were speeding along the level, a
swallow-flight which brought the blood to the girl&#39;s
pale cheeks and the light to her eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I tell ye!&quot; chuckled John Tucker. &quot;Gee whiminy!
Go it, Miss Kitty, he&#39;s fresh: I kep&#39; him in yes&#39;day
a-puppose.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Kitty chirruped; Pilot tossed his handsome head
and sped on the faster.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If I am a daughter of Jehu,&quot; said Kitty, &quot;I might
as well live up to my name, John Tucker!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">So it came to pass that when Kitty Ross came home
to her father&#39;s house, it was with a rush and a swirl
that brought Sarepta flying from the kitchen in a
panic, dish-cloth in one hand, stove-lifter in the other.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My land of the living!&quot; cried Sarepta. &quot;That John
Tucker!&quot;</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page29" id="page29"></a>[pg&nbsp;29]</span></p>

<p class="h2">CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="smcap">ross house</span></p>

<p class="indent">The Ross house stood&mdash;<i>stands</i>, thank heaven!&mdash;on
the north side of the Common, between Judge
Peters&#39;s and Madam Flynt&#39;s, its front windows
facing due south. The main body of the house is of
brick, the two wings and the portico with its Doric
columns, of wood; all gleaming white, with blinds
of exactly the right shade of green. The front fence
(Cyrus has not done away with its fences; it would
scorn to do so. &quot;When I wish to move into my neighbor&#39;s
yard,&quot; says Madam Flynt, &quot;I shall ask his permission
first.&quot; And Miss Almeria Bygood says, &quot;I
prefer to live <i>on</i> the street, not <i>in</i> it&quot;) is of
iron, with chains and tassels elaborately looped; the
posts of white brick, surmounted by wooden balls
large enough for a child to sit on with some measure
of comfort. The gate, a beautiful affair of handwrought
iron (a testimonial to Dr. Ross from a grateful
blacksmith) was made, one would think, to be
swung on. Near the bottom were four grapevine circles,
into which two pairs of small feet fitted perfectly;
while the smooth bar across the top was manifestly
intended for the resting of dimpled chins and the
grasping of chubby hands. Then, its squeak! At the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page30" id="page30"></a>[pg&nbsp;30]</span>
friendly sound, Kitty Ross glanced down, and all her
childhood came flooding back.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, Tommy!&quot; she sighed. &quot;Ah, Duke! We are
too big now, even if you were anywhere.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then the door opened, and there stood Sarepta Darwin,
just as she had stood at similar home-comings all
Kitty&#39;s lifetime.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come in this minute, child!&quot; she said. &quot;You had
the life nigh scared out of me. You, John Tucker,
you&#39;d ought to be ashamed of yourself, at your time
of life!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s just it, S&#39;repty,&quot; chuckled John. &quot;I&#39;ve outgrown
the sensation!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t scold, Sarepta dear!&quot; said Kitty. &quot;I&#39;ve come
home!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Sarepta snorted, and turned her head away. No
one had ever seen a tear in that wintry blue eye, and no
one ever should. The idea!</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&#39;re froze, I expect,&quot; she said severely, &quot;speedin&#39;
like that in this cold. Come in to the fire! Nelly
Chanter&#39;s comin&#39; to supper with you and spend the
night, but I thought you&#39;d want to get your things off
first.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Home! After all the wandering, all the longing:
home at last! Kitty had enjoyed much of the time
abroad. Endless wonder, endless beauty; she rejoiced
to have seen it; but the place where she was born, the
countryside where she belonged, meant more to her
than all the glories of Europe and Asia. So long as
her mother was with her, so long as anything strange
or fair could lift the languid head or bring a gleam
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page31" id="page31"></a>[pg&nbsp;31]</span>
of light to the sad eyes, on they must go, wherever the
brightest way seemed to point: but when it was over,
and the weary body which held the gay, innocent,
flower-like soul, was hid quietly in the churchyard at
Vevey, there was but one thought in Kitty&#39;s mind.
The English cousins, the kind Swiss friends, might
plead as they would; they all wanted her; it would
mean so much to them if she would make her home
with them. Kitty thanked them all with tears, and
took the next and swiftest steamer for home.</p>

<p class="indent">A plain square hall, with stairs going up at one
side; old prints on the walls: Regulus and the Carthaginian
Ambassadors, Cornelia, Mother of the Gracchi:&mdash;Kitty
had a loving glance for all: the very oilcloth
felt friendly under her feet. Had not Grandfather
Ross laid it down fifty years ago, when oilcloth
was oilcloth, and not, as dear Father used to say,
brown paper and fish glue?</p>

<p class="indent">It was late January, but the Christmas wreaths still
hung in the windows, the fir boughs over the picture-frames.
The mail-table, with its scales and weights,
the barometer, the hanging shelf where garden baskets
and implements slept the long winter away&mdash;Kitty&#39;s
glance took them all in lovingly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Fire&#39;s in the settin&#39; room!&quot; said Sarepta.</p>

<p class="indent">Kitty turned to the right, and entered the room she
loved best in the world. Shabby, Mrs. Sharpe called
the sitting room of Ross House. If it was shabby, no
one but Mrs. Sharpe knew it. The rugs were worn, it
is true, the original patterns lost in a warm blending
of reds and blues, but they were still thick and soft,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page32" id="page32"></a>[pg&nbsp;32]</span>
and only Sarepta knew of the mended places. The
wallpaper had not been changed since the memory of
man. Why should it be, when it was in perfect condition?
And how much of it was visible anyhow?
Mellow, rich, warm: one sought for other kindred
words, feeling the friendly harmony of everything
from the Piranesi etchings to the books which lined
half the walls and lay on every available flat surface.
The fireplace occupied most of one side, the fire leaped
and crackled behind the high fender&mdash;not so high as
it used to be, Kitty, when you and Tom &quot;stumped&quot;
each other to climb on it and grimace at your reflections
in the round balls of the andirons. A leather
sofa stood before the fireplace: well! I grant that the
sofa was shabby, but who cared? Never was another,
old or new, to compare with it in comfort. Kitty sank
down on it now, and stretched her hands to the blaze,
and made a little sound, half moan, half coo, of utter
thankfulness. Sarepta, erect in the doorway, hands
folded over her spotless apron, had the air of waiting
for something. Presently Kitty spoke over her shoulder,
her eyes still fixed on the fire.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She didn&#39;t suffer at all, Sarepta!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Sarepta grunted.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She just faded away quietly, like a flower. It
was like&mdash;do you remember how I used to put the
hollyhocks in the little black pool, under the trees?
They didn&#39;t wither or crumple up, they just grew more
transparent, day by day, till at last they seemed almost
to melt into the water: it was more like that than anything
else.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page33" id="page33"></a>[pg&nbsp;33]</span>
Sarepta grunted again. &quot;Got your feet wet reg&#39;lar
every time you did it!&quot; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She knew she was going,&quot; the clear lovely voice
went on, as if repeating a lesson. &quot;She asked me to&mdash;to
leave her there, among the flowers: she was so tired,
she thought it would trouble her in heaven to know
that&mdash;it&mdash;was being carried about. And then&mdash;she
said&mdash;&#39;Go home, darling! Go home to&mdash;Sarepta and
John Tucker: they will&mdash;take&mdash;care&mdash;&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The clear voice faltered, broke: Sarepta Darwin
threw her apron over her head and went away.</p>

<p class="indent">An hour later, a composed and cheerful Kitty was
greeting Nelly Chanter, who came in rosy and breathless
as usual, full of tender incoherence.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Darling Kitty! so heavenly of Sarepta to ask me
to come! I <i>didn&#39;t</i> mean to be&mdash;oh, Kitty, you are home
again! I thought you <i>never</i>&mdash;what a perfectly delicious
kitten!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">All the embarrassment was Nelly&#39;s, and she did not
quite know what to make of the sensation, an unfamiliar
one to Chanters; but she was, as Sarepta said, the
most sensible of them, and followed Kitty&#39;s lead readily.
The trunks had come, Kitty said; they wouldn&#39;t
begin really to unpack, it was too near supper time, but
she must just open the little leather one, and get out&mdash;come
along!</p>

<p class="indent">Up the stairs they went, every step holding its greeting
for Kitty, every touch of the carved rail sending
its little thrill through her; round the turn, up to the
landing, where the orange tree was in full fruitage&mdash;one,
two, three,&mdash;<i>twelve</i> oranges!</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page34" id="page34"></a>[pg&nbsp;34]</span>
&quot;Do look, Nelly! Sarepta is a wonder, isn&#39;t she?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Past the door from which the voice had always
called as she went by, &quot;Kitty my Pretty! is that you?&quot;&mdash;silent
now; the door open, of course, Sarepta knew
enough for that, but not to be glanced at yet&mdash;not yet!
So into her own room opposite, where the fire crackled
as gayly as in the room below, and the curtains were
drawn and the candles lighted.</p>

<p class="indent">The little leather trunk, being investigated, yielded
up a lace blouse, the most exquisite dream of a thing,
according to Nelly, that ever was seen. It couldn&#39;t
be for her! no! It wasn&#39;t possible! Reassured on this
point, Nelly was overwhelmed. How could she ever,
ever, <i>ever</i> thank Kitty enough?</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hush, Nelly! it isn&#39;t half pretty enough for you.
Tell me about everybody! Your mother is well, you
say? How is Madam Flynt?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very well, except for her rheumatism. I saw her
this morning: she sent her best love, and hopes you
will come in to-morrow. She can&#39;t walk much in this
slippery weather: she has been driving&mdash;&quot; Nelly
stopped suddenly, with a queer look: one would say a
guilty look.</p>

<p class="indent">Kitty, now in her white wrapper, brushing out her
long fair hair before the glass, and looking, Nelly
thought, like a heavenly mermaid, did not see the look.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, she wouldn&#39;t be driving next door anyhow,&quot;
she said. &quot;I&#39;ll run over right after breakfast. Let
me see! I&#39;ve seen all the dearest people, except your
mother and Madam Flynt. Wasn&#39;t it darling of them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page35" id="page35"></a>[pg&nbsp;35]</span>
to come to meet me? How handsome Miss Almeria
looked! How are the Wibirds, Nell?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Much as usual, I think. Melissa is poorly, but she
keeps on at the Library. I don&#39;t think she&#39;s having a
very good winter. Poor Melissa!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Nelly&#39;s rosy face clouded slightly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wilson?&quot; Kitty spoke low.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes! pretty bad this winter, I&#39;m afraid. Mrs. Wibird
can&#39;t control him, nor any one else except Mr.
Mallow and Billy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How&#39;s Mr. Cheeseman?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, just the same! all agog to see you, like every
one else. I was in there yesterday, and he was making
every kind of candy you had ever liked since you were
a baby, so he&#39;d be sure to have the right thing on hand.
And Mr. Bygood was so excited about your coming
he got no nap yesterday, and Miss Egeria was so worried!
But Miss Almeria told her joy was the best
thing for the aged, so she cheered up. My dear, I
think you&#39;ll have to go and see them <i>all</i> to-morrow, or
they will all pass away, and there will be no Cyrus
left. <i>Kitty!</i>&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, dear!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At Nelly&#39;s explosive utterance of her name, Kitty,
whose toilet had been progressing while they talked,
paused, slipper in hand.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is it, Nelly?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, nothing! that is&mdash;well, Mother just wanted
me to say that we hope you will come to live with
us!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, Nelly!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page36" id="page36"></a>[pg&nbsp;36]</span>
Nelly went on with a rush. &quot;I know the house is
small and crowded, but just listen! The boys are
<i>dying</i> to have you, simply dying! So they will sleep
in the barn-chamber, and Zephine and I will take their
room, and you will have ours. We&#39;ve got it all planned
out, and the boys have always wanted to have the barn-chamber,
and they will fit it up themselves, so you see
it will be the most convenient thing in the world, besides
making us all so happy we want to dance whenever
we think of it. Now, Kitty, say you&#39;ll think about
it? Of course, you can&#39;t decide this moment, and of
course the other houses are bigger, and you may say
some of them are lonely&mdash;the people, not the houses!&mdash;but
you <i>will</i> think about it, Kitty, won&#39;t you, and remember
that we spoke first!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Kitty&#39;s eyes were wide with astonishment, but full
of affection.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course I will, Nelly! Why, I never heard of
anything so kind in my life. Thank your dear mother
a thousand times, and tell her&mdash;but I shall tell her myself.
There&#39;s the bell! Come along. I&#39;m sure Sarepta
has pop-overs for us!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Sarepta had pop-overs for them, marvelous efflorescences
of brown and gold, such as all Europe could not
afford. Kitty exclaiming to this effect, Sarepta grimly
supposed they hadn&#39;t the faculty, and drew attention to
the creamed chicken and oysters, which were done the
way Kitty used to like &#39;em, though Sarepta presumed
she&#39;d learned newer-fangled ways over there. Mebbe
she wouldn&#39;t care. Reassured on this point, she
handed the fried potatoes with a challenging air&mdash;she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page37" id="page37"></a>[pg&nbsp;37]</span>
<i>knew</i> no one could beat her there&mdash;and retired, to
count over every word Kitty had said and store it
away for future need.</p>

<p class="indent">The girls fell to their supper as healthy, hungry
girls should, and for a time conversation was chiefly
exclamatory, dealing with the wonders of Sarepta&#39;s
cookery. By and by, however, over the ice-cream
which made it a &quot;party,&quot; as they exclaimed with delight,
and later, sitting on the sofa before the singing,
purring fire, they had much talk, Kitty telling of
things she had seen abroad, Nelly wondering, admiring,
exclaiming. But always the talk would come back
to Cyrus, the home of their hearts, and to the people
who lived there. Only two thousand, all told, this including
the three French families and the two &quot;Polanders&quot;
down by the little woolen mill which was our
one &quot;industry,&quot; so that between them the two girls
knew or knew of almost every one within the village
limits. It was a farming community, save for the comfortable
store-keepers, and the half dozen &quot;tony&quot; families
as Mrs. Sharpe called them, whose ample mansions,
white or yellow, had stood about the Common since
Colonial days. Cyrus, her people were wont to say,
did not <i>grow</i>: she <i>remained</i>. I don&#39;t know just why
they were proud of this stationary quality, but they
certainly were. For fifty years, the population had
hardly changed; or to be accurate, it had changed in
so gradual and regular a fashion that it always seemed
the same. An accurate observer like Judge Peters
would tell you that once in about thirty years there
were more children: the schools were fuller, the wave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>[pg&nbsp;38]</span>
of youth crept slowly up till street and meeting house
blossomed with youths and maidens. Then, still gradually,
the wave would recede: some of the lads went
away to work, some of the lasses married &quot;out-of-towners&quot;;
the numbers dwindled again, till in another
thirty years another vigorous generation would come
shouting to the front.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And <i>how</i> is Savory Bite?&quot; asked Kitty. &quot;Does he
still live alone?&quot; (This gentleman&#39;s real name was
Avery Bright, but he was never called by it.)</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My dear, yes! No one goes near him: where is
the use, when he won&#39;t let any one in? He did our
garden last spring, and was just the same, snapping
your head off if you spoke to him. I have never been
in the house, though I have peeped in the window
sometimes. It&#39;s always neat as wax, I&#39;ll say that for
Savory.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Kitty gave a little sudden laugh.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ve been in it!&quot; she said. &quot;Tom and I got in one
day through the cellar; he had left the door unlocked.
We got up into the kitchen, and had a wonderful time.
You know everything is painted blue, floor, tables,
chairs, everything? Well, naughty Tom had a piece
of chalk in his pocket, and what does he do but write
on the blue table in big letters,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;&#39;Savory Bite,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Why not paint it white?&#39;&quot;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">A silence fell: then Nelly asked the question which
had been on her tongue twenty times, and twenty times
kept back.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page39" id="page39"></a>[pg&nbsp;39]</span>
&quot;Where is Tom, Kitty? Do you know?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Kitty looked straight at her with honest eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t know, Nelly. I haven&#39;t heard one word
from him. I wrote,&quot; she added, &quot;when Father died&mdash;that
was after Mrs. Lee&#39;s death, but I knew he was
in Omaha, and I had his uncle&#39;s address&mdash;but I never
had one word of answer.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">If a writer could only tell all she knows! That
letter, Kitty, in which you poured out your sad heart
to the lad who had been brother, playmate and boy
lover ever since you can remember, is in the pocket of
his uncle&#39;s spring overcoat, now laid away in camphor,
till the first of May, when he changes from winter
to spring clothes, regardless of weather. His uncle
is not a villain, far from it; he would gladly forward
the letter, only he does not know it is there, nor will
till the above date.</p>

<p class="indent">As for Tom&#39;s letter to you, Kitty, written about the
same time, I don&#39;t know whose pocket that is in. He
wrote it on board the steamer at San Francisco, and
sent it back by the pilot: but it never reached you. It
was a good letter, too. Tom knew nothing of Dr.
Ross&#39;s death: full of his own recent loss of a beloved
mother, he thought of you in your happy home with
the two dear and delightful parents who seemed to
belong almost equally to him&mdash;almost! He told you
of his great &quot;job&quot;; he begged you to think of him
whenever you had a minute to spare, but not to bother
about writing, because he had no address to give beyond
the Shanghai Bank, and he might not get back
there for a year or two, from the way the job looked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>[pg&nbsp;40]</span>
at this end. But you would know he was thinking
about you, and you must be a good Cat and purr a
great deal, and not scratch anybody except Wilson
Wibird. And when he came back, Kitty&mdash;well, perhaps
he&#39;d better wait till then, but all the same you
<i>knew</i> well enough, so he remained yours always,
The Duke of Lee.</p>

<p class="indent">Yes, that letter would have comforted Kitty a great
deal: it was a pity she did not get it.</p>

<p class="indent">Tom, meanwhile, building bridges in a remote province
of northern China, supposed comfortably that
she had got it, and thought of her daily with great
contentment.</p>

<p class="indent">So things go&mdash;sometimes! And here is Sarepta with
the bedroom candles.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>[pg&nbsp;41]</span></p>

<p class="h2">CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="smcap">the home guard</span></p>

<p class="indent">Early next morning, Nelly was off for her
school. Kitty, after waving her good-bye from
the gate, went back into the house; into the
kitchen, where she knew Sarepta was expecting her.
&quot;You come out quick as you get shet of her!&quot; had
been the mandate, which Kitty would never have
thought of disobeying.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dear kitchen!&quot; she said. &quot;I saw nothing like this,
in Europe, Sarepta!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I expect not!&quot; said Sarepta, with a lift of her chin.
&quot;Take a seat!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Kitty sat down obediently in a Windsor chair, and
looked about her with great content. Her eyes passed
from the shining stove to the cupboard full of beautiful
old blue crockery, the pride of Sarepta&#39;s heart;
to the scarlet geraniums in the window, the yellow cat
on her scarlet cushion. All good, all delightful. She
had come home.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But what is all this, Sarepta?&quot; asked Kitty.</p>

<p class="indent">On the shining table sat a number of plump little
bags, of stout unbleached cotton, bearing brief inscriptions
in blackest ink. Kitty took them up one by one,
and read in wonder: &quot;Eggs,&quot; &quot;Tomatoes,&quot; &quot;Sarce.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>[pg&nbsp;42]</span>
&quot;What in the world, Sarepta?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Sarepta, standing rigid, her hands folded in her
apron, made austere reply.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There was no reason as I know of why things
should go to waste. Your Ma wasn&#39;t fit to see to &#39;em
before she went away. There wasn&#39;t no need she
should. I should hope I knew <i>something</i>! This&mdash;&quot;
she took up the stoutest bag, &quot;is the egg and chicken
money. The hens has done real well; I&#39;ve sold eggs
and broilers and roosters. You count that!&quot; She
named a sum. &quot;I expect it&#39;s right.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sarepta! you dear, good soul! How could you&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This is sarce!&quot; Sarepta continued, taking up another
bag. &quot;Sugar was low and fruit was high, so
I done well there too. I made two hundred glasses of
currant jell, and three hundred of grape, and&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But, Sarepta! What did you do with them all?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sold &#39;em! Mis&#39; Flynt wasn&#39;t puttin&#39; up, herself,
this year, didn&#39;t want to bother with it. No more did
Miss Bygoods. And Mr. Mallow gi&#39; me the hull of
his order, so you see&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I see!&quot; Kitty became thoughtful. &quot;Sarepta&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well!&quot; the answer was a snap, thrown backward
over an uncompromising shoulder. Sarepta was suddenly
very busy at the stove, rattling and raking with
much commotion.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sarepta! You didn&#39;t&mdash;you didn&#39;t <i>ask</i> for these orders,
did you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Sarepta turned round; her face was like an iceberg
carved with a jackknife.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Was your Pa satisfied with me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page43" id="page43"></a>[pg&nbsp;43]</span>
&quot;Sarepta! You know he adored you!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Was your Ma satisfied with me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sarepta dear! Don&#39;t be cantankerous!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Was</i> your Ma satisfied with me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course she was! How can you&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I made sarce before you was born or thought of!&quot;
Sarepta&#39;s tone expressed finality. &quot;I&#39;ve always made
it&mdash;and I&#39;ve never took it!&quot; she added with a grim
chuckle which splintered the iceberg in a singular way.
&quot;Anything else?&quot; Sarepta&#39;s tone was amiable, but
conveyed the idea that she had things to do, however
it might be with other people.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Just one thing, Sarepta dear, and then I&#39;ll go.
Have you taken your wages out of this money? If
not, hadn&#39;t we better settle it now?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Sarepta made no immediate reply. Instead, she
examined the draughts of the stove one by one, with
meticulous care. Apparently satisfied with their condition,
she next proceeded to brush the stove top
(which did not need brushing) and to fill the kettle
with ostentatious zeal. Kitty waited patiently, enjoying
the kitchen and stroking the yellow cat. Finally,
Sarepta washed her hands elaborately, rolled them in
her apron, and turned round. So turning, she displayed
the iceberg set again in rigid lines. The words
appeared to freeze as they dropped from her lips. Sarepta
had come to this house with Kitty&#39;s Ma, she intimated,
when first she come here a bride.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sarepta,&quot; Mrs. Ross had said, &quot;this is my home,
and it is yours, too, as long as you live.&quot; Was that so,
or wasn&#39;t it?</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page44" id="page44"></a>[pg&nbsp;44]</span>
&quot;Yes, Sarepta, that is true.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, then! I was offered a home, and I expect a
home, long as I need it. When I want wages, I&#39;ll ask
for &#39;em. It&#39;s likely I&#39;d take &#39;em from a child like
you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>But</i>&mdash;&quot; cried Kitty.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Butter!&quot; replied Sarepta. Then they both felt better,
for this was the give and take of Kitty&#39;s childhood.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I do wish you would be reasonable, Sarepta!
John Tucker has always had his wages, hasn&#39;t he?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;John Tucker has a wife and fam&#39;ly. His wife has
about as much gumption as a week-old guinea-pig, and
the way that eldest boy of theirs is growin&#39; up is
enough to scare the feathers off a hen; he&#39;s got to
have wages, of course. And I&#39;ve had &#39;em, Kitty, all
I wanted, and money in the bank. My uncle left me
his farm and savin&#39;s, last year, if you <i>have</i> to know.
And if I&#39;m pestered any more&mdash;&quot; Sarepta&#39;s voice
dropped to an ominous note&mdash;&quot;I&#39;ll go and live there!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There!&quot; she added in a different tone. &quot;You just
let me do the way I want to, Kitty, and we&#39;ll get along
first rate. I&#39;m crotchety, but yet I mean well; only I
can&#39;t bear to be crossed. Run along now, child, and
take your money. I&#39;d put it in the bank if I was you.
I&#39;m busy now,&quot; she added abruptly, as Kitty tried to
speak. &quot;Besides, that John Tucker wanted you should
come out to the stable right away. Dinner at one
o&#39;clock!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dear me!&quot; sighed Kitty, as she made her way toward
the stable. &quot;I feel just like Alice in Wonderland:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page45" id="page45"></a>[pg&nbsp;45]</span>
I never was ordered about so in my life. Dear old
thing! I shall always be ten to her, I suppose. But
her name ought to be Pomona: she&#39;s right out of &#39;Rudder
Grange&#39;! Now for John Tucker! I hope <i>he</i> hasn&#39;t
been making sarce!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">John Tucker was wont to say, Sarepty&#39;s kitchen was
all right, but give him the harness-room! He was in
the harness-room now, and it certainly was a pleasant
place. A quaint little stove, of antiquated pattern, faced
the door, and in front of the stove were two comfortable
wooden arm-chairs, one for John and one for a
visitor. John generally had visitors, in his few spare
hours. People came to ask him everything&mdash;except
in the medical way&mdash;that they used to ask Dr. Ross.
The window of the little room looked out on the garden,
the glazed upper half of the door gave a cheerful
prospect of the stable, with its white-swathed vehicles&mdash;the
doctor&#39;s buggy, the little phaeton, the old carryall,
rather past use, but a wonderful place to play house
in. You could not see the two box-stalls from the
harness-room, for they were on the same side of the
stable; but you could hear Pilot and Dan stamping
and talking to each other through the partition. Kitty
had already visited them, and given them sugar, and
rubbed their dear velvet noses, and wept a little on
their sympathetic necks.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good morning, John! How cosy you look in
here!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good morning, Miss Kitty! Step in! step in! I&#39;m
pleased to see you. Take a seat, won&#39;t you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Kitty sat down obediently, as she had done in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page46" id="page46"></a>[pg&nbsp;46]</span>
kitchen. John&#39;s tone was not Sarepta&#39;s: he was
never autocratic. When Kitty was three, he had advanced
the opinion that &quot;this filly must be druv with
the snaffle!&quot; and had regulated his words and ways accordingly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The horses look beautifully, John! Of course, they
always do.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">John expected the horses might look worse. He
didn&#39;t know as they would be special easy to beat in
this county&mdash;or State, either, come to that!</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What a beauty Pilot is! And dear old Dan is just
as handsome in his way. I suppose they are quite valuable
horses, John?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I s&#39;pose they be!&quot; John Tucker spoke gruffly, and
turned his head away. Something in the girl&#39;s tone
and wistful look made his eyes smart. He put too
much pepper on that fur robe, he knowed he did when
he done it. Thus John Tucker, muttering.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I asked, John dear, because&mdash;&quot; Kitty&#39;s hand was
on his arm now, fingering his rough sleeve as she
used to in the days when she sat on his knee and, being
interrogated as to whose gal she was, replied, &quot;Don
Tutter&#39;s dal!&quot;&mdash;&quot;because&mdash;I suppose we ought to sell
them, John Tucker, dear. There is very, very little
money, you know. Was that what you wanted to see
me about, John?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Miss Kitty!&quot; John Tucker turned his rugged face
toward her now, and it was aglow with feeling: &quot;Don&#39;t
sell them hosses! That was what I wanted to say to
you, and I say it again. Don&#39;t sell them hosses! If
money is needed, and I&#39;m aware it is, there is more
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page47" id="page47"></a>[pg&nbsp;47]</span>
money to be made by keepin&#39; them hosses than by
sellin&#39; &#39;em. Lemme tell you; don&#39;t be mad with me,
Miss Kitty, for I done the best I knew how.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course you did, John! As if you ever did anything
else. Why do you look at me so strangely, John
Tucker?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Miss Kitty, I say it again, I done the best I knew
how. Now lemme tell you! You remember Flanagan?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Flanagan, the cab-driver? Of course I do! Why,
I didn&#39;t see him at the station yesterday. Wasn&#39;t he
there? He used to say he never missed a train.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He&#39;s missed consid&#39;ble many lately,&quot; said John
Tucker grimly. &quot;Flanagan&#39;s complaint is that he&#39;s
dead. Yes, ma&#39;am,&quot; in answer to Kitty&#39;s exclamation,
&quot;dropped off settin&#39; right there in his team at the
depot. Folks was surprised.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I should think so! Why, Flanagan! Why, John,
I should as soon think of the train&#39;s dying! What do
people do without him?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">John Tucker cleared his throat elaborately.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I happened to be there, and I drove the folks home
that he&#39;d come to fetch. That was the way it began.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The way what began, John Tucker?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">John Tucker rose and looked out of the window.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wind&#39;s workin&#39; round no&#39;theast!&quot; he muttered.
&quot;We shall have snow flyin&#39; before night. Miss Kitty,
you&#39;ll see it reasonable, I know you will. Take a look
at it by and large!&quot; He turned, and threw an appealing
look at the girl. &quot;Here was Flanagan dead, warn&#39;t
he? And no insurance, so to speak. Hosses and cab
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page48" id="page48"></a>[pg&nbsp;48]</span>
sold to pay for the funeral and the board bill: hadn&#39;t
no folks, Flanagan hadn&#39;t; boarded to Widow Peavey&#39;s.
Well! there was the train to be met mornin&#39; and
night, and there was Madam Flynt to be took her
airin&#39;, and Mr. Bygood sim&#39;lar, to and from the store.
The gals don&#39;t want him to walk up the hill, &#39;cause of
his heart, and I dono as I blame &#39;em. Considerin&#39; his
age, you know. And&mdash;the hosses had to be exercised,
no two ways about that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He paused: Kitty&#39;s eyes were shining, and she took
up the word eagerly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And you have been doing all this, John Tucker!
You have been meeting the trains and taking the dear
people to drive, while they are finding some one in
Flanagan&#39;s place? You <i>clever</i> John! Why, I think it
was a wonderful idea! Of course I am perfectly delighted.
And have they found a new Flanagan yet?
Because, of course, you&#39;ll go right on till they&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">John Tucker&#39;s face was almost as craggy as Sarepta&#39;s,
as he faced Kitty again:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Found?&quot; he said gruffly. &quot;They&#39;ve found me. I&#39;m
Flanagan: you&#39;re Flanagan. Miss Kitty&mdash;&quot; he lifted
a newspaper from the little table, displaying sundry
piles of silver coin, arranged in neat pyramids; the
base &quot;cart-wheels&quot; dollars, the top dimes. &quot;Here&#39;s
your money!&quot; said John. &quot;All that&#39;s ben taken in
this six months since Flanagan died. You can take
out my wages, if you&#39;re a mind to, &#39;count of Mary and
the children: the rest is yours, lawful money, well
airned, if I say it. Don&#39;t&mdash;don&#39;t you cry, Miss Kitty!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page49" id="page49"></a>[pg&nbsp;49]</span>
don&#39;t you now! I done the best I knew how. I talked
it over with Judge Peters, and he said, &#39;Stu&#39; boy&#39;; &#39;twas
the best I could do; Mis&#39; Flynt the same, and
Sarepty. Don&#39;t you cry, Miss Kitty!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Kitty explained through her tears that she wasn&#39;t
really crying; it was only because every one was so
darling and kind, and&mdash;and&mdash;why did the tears come
so easily? There had been none, until she came home;
she had longed for them sometimes, when her head
throbbed, and her eyes burned so hot and dry; now, the
least thing brought them welling up, and every time
some band seemed loosed from her heart.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It seems very&mdash;very strange, John Tucker, dear,
to be taking money from the neighbors!&quot; Kitty dried
her eyes and looked up. &quot;I am going to be sensible,
John, and I know you did the very best&mdash;but it does
seem strange, John Tucker! do you think Father would
like it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">John Tucker&#39;s eyes were very blue and very bright.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Miss Kitty, if there is one thing under the canopy
that I am sure of, it&#39;s that Doctor would approve.
Doctor, you see, was reasonable. He&#39;d see right off
that here on one side was hosses to be fed, and grain
costin&#39; thus and so; and hosses to be exercised, or
they&#39;d go lame and poor. And he&#39;d see on the other
side, here was folks needin&#39; to be hauled, and no one
to haul &#39;em. Well, then Doctor would say,&mdash;&#39;pears
like I could hear him, and have heard him right along,
&#39;When you&#39;re dealin&#39; with hosses,&#39; he&#39;d say, &#39;you need
hoss sense.&#39; And this is hoss sense, Miss Kitty, or I
don&#39;t know it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page50" id="page50"></a>[pg&nbsp;50]</span>
Kitty rose and held out her little hand, to be engulfed
in John Tucker&#39;s huge brown one.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s enough, John Tucker!&quot; she said; and up
went her chin. &quot;I can hear him, too. We will be partners,
John: Tucker and Ross! Only you will do all
the work, John Tucker dear, I know you will.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">John Tucker, looking at her, fell into such a glowing
state that the stove was nowhere beside him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now there!&quot; he said. &quot;What did I tell you? She&#39;s
her Pa&#39;s own gal!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And now I <i>must</i> go and see Madam Flynt! You
say she knows all about the Great Plan, John?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And approves! Madam Flynt is a real sensible
woman.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He followed Kitty out of the harness-room, and
they moved instinctively to the stalls, where two dark
satin heads were thrust eagerly forward, two velvet
noses sneezed and sniffed in eager greeting.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You darlings!&quot; cried Kitty. &quot;No, Dan, no more
sugar. You are not a pet lamb any more, dear: you
are a Horse of Business, and must realize your responsibilities.
I shall drive Madam Flynt myself, John,
most days.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I thought likely you would!&quot; chuckled John.
&quot;You&#39;ll have to go keerful, though, Miss Kitty; it&#39;s
slow and sure with Madam Flynt. None of your Bible
doin&#39;s with her along!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bible doings? What <i>do</i> you mean, John Tucker?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">John Tucker chuckled again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I was only thinkin&#39; of Doctor!&quot; he said. &quot;&#39;A
daughter of Jehu, for behold she driveth furiously&#39;.&quot;</p>

<p class="h2">CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="smcap">the neighbors</span></p>

<p class="indent">Madam Flynt was evidently expecting
Kitty. She was ready dressed and in the
drawing-room: the large, bright room with
its hangings of apple green and gold brocade, its gilded
cornices and fire screen. Dr. Ross used to say that
the room was an apple-tree bower, and Madam Flynt
the apple; indeed, she did look like one, a Bellefleur,
say, or a rosy Porter. A woman of sixty, large, massive,
fair. Her hair was faded from the bright gold
of her girlhood, but was still yellow; her eyes were
China blue, her cheeks apple red. The color was so
set in them (no one had ever seen Madam Flynt pale,
even in sickness) that a stranger might well think it
clumsy art, instead of&mdash;what shall I say, over-zealous
Nature? The story ran that one day in her youth,
walking along the street, she heard a stranger say
after passing her, &quot;Painted, by God!&quot; She turned instantly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; she said calmly, &quot;I <i>am</i> painted by God!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Of course this was not in Cyrus: Cyrus people
knew.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, Kitty!&quot; Madam Flynt held out a large, plump
white hand, amply be-ringed. She was dressed in flowing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page52" id="page52"></a>[pg&nbsp;52]</span>
robes of green and white, a most un-negligent
&quot;<i>negligée</i>,&quot; and was a pleasant sight enough. &quot;Well,
Kitty! You have to come to me, you see. I couldn&#39;t
go down with the rest of the town to meet you. I am
glad to see you, my dear. We have been too long without
you, Kitty.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dear Madam Flynt, I am so glad to get home!
How is the rheumatism?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The rheumatism is very well, Kitty, it thanks you:
it&#39;s more vigorous than I am; but I do very well, on
the whole, very well. I get my airing, which is the
principal thing. John Tucker told you of our little
arrangement? A very good plan! John Tucker is a
sensible man. He and Sarepta are really an able pair.
Pity he didn&#39;t marry her, instead of that poor creature,
Mary Spinney. You had a good voyage, my
dear?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She talked easily, Kitty following her lead.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Glad to hear it! And now, Kitty, I hope you are
going to be a sensible girl, and do as I wish.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;As you wish, Madam Flynt? About the driving?
Oh, surely! I am only too grateful. It is so dear of
you&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nothing of the kind! A business arrangement,
nothing more. Flanagan was dead&mdash;I didn&#39;t kill him,
did I? What I wish, Kitty, is quite another thing. I
want you to come and live with me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Madam Flynt!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There is everything to be said in favor of the plan,&quot;
Madam Flynt swept on, &quot;and nothing against it, so
far as I can see. You can manage your home affairs,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page53" id="page53"></a>[pg&nbsp;53]</span>
John and Sarepta, the house and so on, as well here
as there; you&#39;ve only to step across the yard. I need
a companion, and so do you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Kitty opened wide eyes of astonishment.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Madam Flynt! Has Miss Croly left you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Miss Croly left me? Certainly not. Why should
she leave me? Cornelia Croly is as old as I am, or
very near it; she needs a companion, too. She grows
more set every day of her life. Just move that poker,
will you, Kitty? To the left side of the fireplace!
Cornelia Croly <i>will</i> always put it at the right; she does
it to assert herself; she told me so, in so many words.
We both need a young person to keep us from biting
each other, Kitty, and you are the person.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At this point, Miss Croly entered the room, beaming
welcome. Tall, thin, upright, hard-favored, with the
kindest eyes and the most obstinate chin imaginable.
Dressed in gray alpaca by day, in purple alpaca by
night, with little benefit of fashion; such was Miss
Cornelia Croly, Madam Flynt&#39;s quondam schoolmate&mdash;her
companion now these many years of her widowhood.
The two made a singular contrast, yet complemented
each other oddly. Kitty could never think of
one without the other. Corolla and calyx, Dr. Ross
used to call them.</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Croly had to hear all about Kitty&#39;s voyage;
the sea had a fascination for her, though she had never
ventured upon it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A storm! how thrilling! the wonders of the deep!&quot;
sighed Miss Croly, all in one breath. &quot;You make it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page54" id="page54"></a>[pg&nbsp;54]</span>
all so real, Kitty. I can hear the roar of the elements
and the dash of the breakers&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">As she spoke, Miss Croly had taken up the poker,
and after making a dab at the fire, was gently replacing
it at the right of the fireplace, when Madam Flynt
interrupted her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There are no breakers in mid-ocean, Cornelia!
And will you kindly leave the poker where it was, on
the left side?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Excuse me, my dear Clarissa, it is far more convenient
on the right side. As attending to the fire is
one of my little duties&mdash;a very pleasant one, I am
sure&mdash;it seems not unreasonable for me to have the
poker where I can use it. You grant that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Seeing Argument throned on both brows, Kitty rose
hastily and made her excuses. She had several other
visits to make; she would run in this evening, or surely
to-morrow morning. Madam Flynt was the kindest
of the kind, as she always was: yes, Kitty would
think over very carefully what she had said, and would
let her know: she thanked her ever and ever so much:
good-bye! &quot;Good-bye, Miss Croly! So glad to see
you!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Kitty shut the door on a rather awful &quot;Cornelia!&quot;
and fled, only stopping a moment in the kitchen to
greet the two maids, friends of her childhood, and to
steal a cooky from under Sarah Cook&#39;s nose, to the
huge delight of that kindly mammoth.</p>

<p class="indent">Down the street sped Kitty: the dear, friendly street,
where every house smiled a welcome, every window
shed a friendly blink. The Common was on her left,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page55" id="page55"></a>[pg&nbsp;55]</span>
a smooth field of snow, crossed by two intersecting
board walks. Every tree was a friend too: the bare,
graceful branches were moving in the crisp breeze,
and each seemed to wave her a welcome. There was
the Earliest Maple! Kitty wondered what children
drove their spiles and hung their pails now for the
sap. She and Tom used to be rather odious, she
feared, about that tree. They assumed ownership of
all rights in it, both tapping and climbing. She recalled
a keen frosty morning like this, when Wilson
Wibird had &quot;cut in&quot; early, pulled out her spile and
driven in his own. Tom came like a flame of fire
across the Common, tore out the spile and threw it
away, then pummeled Wilson till he ran shrieking
home. Wilson always shrieked when any one touched
him.</p>

<p class="indent">Where next? Judge Peters would be at his office:
she would go down there. He was so wise, he would
tell her what to say to Madam Flynt. Resisting the
call of many a friendly housefront, Kitty went down
the hill and turned into &quot;the Street.&quot; There were several
streets in Cyrus, be it understood, but only one
that began with a capital.</p>

<p class="indent">The first person she met was Wilson Wibird himself.
He was on the opposite sidewalk, and came
across, waving his hand with a familiar gesture.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Weedy, seedy, needy, greedy!&quot; naughty Tom! But
Wilson looked exactly the same, only a man instead of
a hobbledehoy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Katrine! my one thought since I opened my eyes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>[pg&nbsp;56]</span>
this morning. Welcome! a hundred thousand welcomes!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Kitty gave Wilson her hand readily enough, but
she did not altogether like his looks. His eyes were
bloodshot, his speech thick; he seemed to waver a little
as he spoke.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How do you do, Wilson? How is your mother,
and Melissa?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Less well than I, for they have not seen you, Katrine!
You are more beautiful than ever,&quot; murmured
Mr. Wibird. He cast on Kitty what he would have
called a burning glance. To Kitty it looked rather
like a leer, but she must not be unkind. But there was
no earthly reason why Wilson Wibird should hold her
hand, so she removed it firmly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am going to see Judge Peters,&quot; she said: her
tone was cheerfully matter-of-fact. &quot;Give my love at
home, and say I&#39;ll run in soon to see your mother.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My way is yours!&quot; Mr. Wibird announced, and
fell into step, to Kitty&#39;s great annoyance. Wilson Wibird
had been the butt of her childhood and Tom&#39;s;
what on earth did he mean by assuming this tone?</p>

<p class="indent">They were just outside the Mallow House; at this
moment the door opened, and Mr. Very Jordano came
out. He had been taking his leisurely breakfast and
reading his New York paper, sitting in the office with
Marshall Mallow; and seeing the meeting between the
two young people had exchanged a word with his
host and crony, and hastened out.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good morning, Miss Kitty!&quot; he said urbanely.
&quot;The sight of you is a refreshment indeed. Good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page57" id="page57"></a>[pg&nbsp;57]</span>
morning, Wilson. Mr. Mallow would like to see you
a moment, if you have a moment to spare-pare-pare!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Jordano&#39;s tone was faintly ironical, as he fell
into step with Kitty on the other side. Wilson Wibird
glared at him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have not!&quot; he said sullenly. &quot;I am escorting
Miss Ross.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That shall be my privilege!&quot; Mr. Jordano bowed
blandly to Kitty. &quot;Go away, Wilson!&quot; he added in a
lower and different tone. &quot;Go quite away-tay-tay!
Or I&#39;ll call Billy!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Involuntarily, Kitty quickened her pace, Mr. Jordano
beside her. The other stood glowering, irresolute:
suddenly the hotel door opened again, revealing
Mr. Mallow, massive and rosy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You come here, Wilson!&quot; he commanded. &quot;Don&#39;t
stand dilatorin&#39; there! Come on in, you hear me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Mallow was Wilson Wibird&#39;s uncle; Mrs. Wibird
had been a Mallow: moreover, such work as Wilson
did was done for him. The young man, after
kicking the curbstone sullenly for a moment, obeyed
the summons and turned into the hotel.</p>

<p class="indent">Kitty turned to Mr. Jordano with a breath of relief.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Quite so!&quot; returned that gentleman. &quot;He meant
no harm: Wilson meant no harm, but nimporto! Miss
Kitty, I welcome this opportunity for a word with
you. You have been much in my thoughts, both during
your absence and since your return. Miss Kitty,
I feel assured that you have much of the deepest interest
to impart-tart-tart. You will allow me the privilege
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>[pg&nbsp;58]</span>
of calling on you, I trust, some evening in the
near future?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, surely, Mr. Jordano! I shall be very glad indeed
to see you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You have seen my country, Miss Kitty! Ah! counterio
joyoso, would I might behold it! Italy, Miss
Kitty! you have seen Italy?</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, Mr. Jordano, Mother and I spent last winter
in Italy.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah! happy, happy&mdash;that is&mdash;&quot; Mr. Jordano recollected
himself, and changed his look of rapture for
one of sympathy&mdash;&quot; tender reminiscences! tender is
the word. I shall take great pleasure in waiting upon
you, Miss Kitty. It has occurred to me that you might-tite-tite&mdash;that
you might be willing to contribute some
Sketches of Travel to the <i>Centinel</i>. They would be
eagerly welcomed, eagerly welcomed, by all Cyrus and
adjoining towns: the <i>Centinel</i>, you may be aware, has
a considerable circulation. Our editorials are copied&mdash;nimporto!
but if you could give me some sketches,
Miss Kitty, I should regard it as a choice boon. No
laborioso, you understand; nothing that would burden
your&mdash;a&mdash;elegant leisure: a scratch of the pen, a
scratch of the pen! the light feminine touch. It would
indeed be a choice boon. The honorarium&mdash;we could
arrange at a later date-tate-tate. I should wish to be
lib&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Mr. Jordano,&quot; cried downright Kitty, &quot;I never
wrote a word in my life, except just letters, and very
few of them. Why, I <i>couldn&#39;t!</i> and as for writing for
a newspaper&mdash;you take my breath away! But it&#39;s just
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59"></a>[pg&nbsp;59]</span>
as kind of you!&quot; she cried. &quot;I am ever so much obliged,
Mr. Jordano. I wish I could, but I truly could
not. I know I couldn&#39;t.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not at all! not at all!&quot; Mr. Jordano was still bland,
in spite of his evident disappointment. &quot;The modesty
of the sex, Miss Kitty. Perhaps you will be good
enough to think it over. A&mdash;here we are at Judge
Peters&#39;s, and I will leave you. I shall give myself the
pleasure of calling&mdash;ah! good day-tay-tay!&quot; And
the good gentleman bowed himself off, having, indeed,
stolen precious minutes from what he called the Ideals
of Italio, his special contribution to the weekly <i>Centinel</i>.</p>

<p class="indent">Judge Peters, like Madam Flynt, was evidently expecting
Kitty: as if every one in Cyrus were not! The
office windows were as dusty as ever&mdash;Kitty half expected
to see an inscription on them in a round childish
hand:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;Tom-mee,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Duke of Lee.&quot;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">&mdash;but his desk was a miracle of tidiness. His own
person was not more carefully attired than usual, because
that would have been difficult: he was the picture
of a dignified jurist as he sat with his hand in the
breast of his coat, reading a law book of appalling
size and weight.</p>

<p class="indent">His thin, somewhat austere countenance relaxed
at sight of Kitty. He rose and came forward with
extended hands, grasping hers cordially.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My dear child! welcome again! My dear Kitty, I
am heartily glad to see you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>[pg&nbsp;60]</span>
He was: they all were: never was such a welcome,
thought Kitty; another band snapped, and she looked
up into the kindly face with a smile that was almost
merry.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dear Judge Peters! you are so good; everybody is
so good. Never was such a home-coming&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A little stumble here, but only for a moment. Soon
they were seated comfortably, the Judge in his chair,
Kitty on a certain stool which had been hers ever since
she was big enough to visit the &quot;Dudds&quot; in his office,
which was long before she could speak his name plain.
Kitty told her sad little story to a running commentary
of &quot;H&#39;m!&quot; &quot;ha!&quot; or &quot;tut, tut!&quot; which conveyed a
sympathy that needed no words. Then the Judge took
up the thread, and they went through many matters
carefully and thoroughly. Kitty was clear-headed; he
knew that; she had to know just where she stood. Yes,
yes! There was something left, only a little, but a
little was very different from nothing. Now the question
was how they were to add to that little. John and
Sarepta&mdash;yes! yes! good souls! good souls! they had
consulted him. Very right, very proper. A nice little
nest-egg, and John Tucker could carry on the business
perfectly. The question was about Kitty herself. She&mdash;ah&mdash;had
not heard from any of her relatives? True!
she had but one, and&mdash;they need not go into that at
present. Now, the Judge had a proposition to make:
a&mdash;a business proposition. Here was he, a lone man,
sixty years old and not getting any younger. He was
lonely, very lonely, in that big house. It was absurd
that he should be lonely in one house and Kitty in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page61" id="page61"></a>[pg&nbsp;61]</span>
another; &quot;absurd, you see that. Too many lonely
people in Cyrus, as it is. I want you to come and live
with me, Kitty. There! now don&#39;t answer at once:
think it over! I never had a daughter of my own, but
you have always been like a daughter to me, my dear.
I think we could be very comfortable together: very
comfortable. Another thing! I need help here, in
the office; a&mdash;a&mdash;in point of fact, secretary! now, if
you could manage to give me two or three hours a day&mdash;not
too much; not enough to fatigue you, or interfere
with your getting plenty of fresh air and exercise&mdash;and
amusement, too, my dear, amusement, too, of
course!&mdash;why, it would be a great help and comfort
to me, and the salary&mdash;&quot; he named a substantial sum&mdash;&quot;would
help to get&mdash;gloves, you know; fal-lals, my
dear&mdash;toggery of various descriptions. Yes! well, my
dear, how does it strike you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It struck Kitty as the kindest thought that ever was
in the wide world. Why was every one so good to
her? Why, Madam Flynt had asked her to come and
live with her! but&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>That</i>,&quot; Judge Peters struck in with some heat:
&quot;that is unnecessary! Clarissa&mdash;Madam Flynt&mdash;has a
companion already. Cornelia Croly is an excellent
person; they have lived together for twenty years; she
cannot think of discharging Cornelia Croly! Monstrous!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, no! no, indeed, Judge! She only thought&mdash;she
seemed to think&mdash;they both needed some one a little
younger&mdash;but I&mdash;oh no, indeed! I only promised
to think it over.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id="page62"></a>[pg&nbsp;62]</span>
&quot;H&#39;m!&quot; the Judge was quite flushed: he rose and
paced the floor. &quot;The more you think it over, Kitty,
the more unconscionable you will find it. Two
women, used to each other for twenty years, fitting
like ball and socket (I admit an occasional creak of the
joint, but that only makes for variety): a young girl
cooped up in that house, with two elderly women and
a spaniel&mdash;monstrous, my dear! monstrous! Now
my case&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>But!</i>&quot; cried Kitty to herself, as she went down the
stairs, after a solemn promise to think it over well,
&quot;the dear old darling things! not one of them seems
to realize!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Where next? Kitty looked up and down the street.
One way was Cheeseman&#39;s, where one of her oldest
friends would be looking for her, she knew: Mr.
Cheeseman&#39;s, and the Twinnies: on the other&mdash;&quot;Oh,
I must see Miss Egeria and Mr. Bygood before any
one else!&quot; said Kitty, and turned back toward the
Mallow House.</p>

<p class="indent">At Bygoods&#39;, she found the same air of happy
expectation. Miss Egeria had been fluttering to the door
every five minutes all the morning, looking up and
down the street; now she came fluttering to meet Kitty,
and folded her in a tender embrace, and wept over her.
Mrs. Ross had been Miss Egeria&#39;s goddess, and for
her sake, Kitty seemed to the dear lady only half mortal.
She uttered little soft moans in which &quot;Heaven,&quot;
&quot;saint,&quot; &quot;crown of glory,&quot; and the like could be
distinguished. It was Kitty who comforted her with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page63" id="page63"></a>[pg&nbsp;63]</span>
soothing words and affectionate pats, and soon Miss
Egeria collected herself and dried her eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Forgive me, dear child!&quot; she said. &quot;I am so glad,
Kitty, so happy to see you! Sister is in back with
Father; come right in, won&#39;t you dear? They are
so eager&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Here was Miss Almeria herself, stately and handsome,
parting the curtains with a welcoming gesture:
here was Mr. Bygood leaning forward in his armchair,
his mild eyes shining, his lips trembling with eagerness.
Such a welcome here, too, as never could be
anywhere else except in dear Cyrus.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mr. Bygood, you have been growing younger!&quot;
Kitty spoke with decision. &quot;I believe you have found
the Fountain of Youth. I think you might give me a
drop!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, no, my dear!&quot; Mr. Bygood quavered in high
delight. &quot;An old hulk, Kitty, left high and dry, high
and dry.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;I came there again when the day was declining,</span><br />
<span class="i0">The bark was still there, but the waters were gone.</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">You remember the song, my dear?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Indeed I do, Mr. Bygood. You are going to sing
it to me the very first I come to tea. When may I
come to tea, Miss Almegeria?&quot; This was her child
name for the two sisters. &quot;I want Banbury cakes,
please, and apple sauce with whipped cream.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And fried oysters!&quot; Miss Almeria beamed; Miss
Egeria cooed, &quot;You shall come to-night, if you will,
Kitty. To-night and&mdash;presently!&quot; Miss Almeria cast
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>[pg&nbsp;64]</span>
a warning look at her sister, on whose lips something
seemed to be trembling. &quot;Presently, Sister! Father&#39;s
turn now; ours can wait!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have brought you a little present, Mr. Bygood!&quot;
Kitty was pulling something from her pocket; a little
parcel, white tissue paper neatly tied with blue
ribbon. The old gentleman opened it with trembling
fingers. Only a bit of Derbyshire spar, Kitty explained,
for the Collection; but he exclaimed delightedly
at sight of the pretty thing, a golden egg darting
rays as the sunlight struck it; surely, the Ph&oelig;nix&#39;s
egg, or as near it as mortal eyes may hope to see.
Kitty was thanked, blessed, questioned, thanked again.
Then she begged for a sight of Goody Twoshoes, and
got it, and Marmaduke Multiply, too, because poor
Tom had been so fond of it. Yes, poor Tom! Nobody
heard from him, which was very sad. If he had
only stayed in Cyrus, Mr. Bygood said, it would have
been so much better: so much better! The old gentleman
sighed, and shook his white head, fumbling
meantime in his pockets for peppermint drops.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You know,&quot; Miss Egeria whispered to Kitty,
&quot;Father offered Thomas a position in the store!&quot; Her
tone implied affairs of Rothschildic scope. &quot;It would
have been such an opportunity for Thomas!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hush, sister!&quot; Miss Almeria spoke with some severity.
&quot;Thomas had his own views; I am told he
considered Cyrus slow! It is true I did not hear him
say it!&quot; she added more gently.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Believe half that you see and nothing that you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65"></a>[pg&nbsp;65]</span>
hear!&quot; murmured Mr. Bygood gently. &quot;Tom was a
dear boy, Almeria!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, Father dear! You set me right, as ever!&quot;
Miss Almeria patted his shoulder affectionately. &quot;We
must not judge!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Almy is impulsive!&quot; Mr. Bygood smiled to Kitty.
&quot;Youth is apt to be. Do you find Cyrus changed, my
dear?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Presently he nodded, and on a sign from the ladies,
Kitty stole into the front shop with them. Here they
unfolded their great plan, which was just like all the
rest. Kitty was to come and live with them: to be
their&mdash;their younger sister, as it were. They had a
little room&mdash;the blue room! Kitty remembered? She
used to like it. It was never used, and it would be
<i>such</i> a happiness to them! She could help in the store&mdash;it
was so interesting, Kitty, and truly educational,
with the Library and all.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The gentlemen come in, too, for their morning
paper, my dear, and discuss affairs of National Importance!
I assure you, we feel that we have <i>great</i>
opportunities, and I trust we are not ungrateful for
them. Our gentlemen have such <i>sound</i> opinions!
When I hear Judge Peters and Mr. Jordano exchange
their views on public affairs, and dear Father adds his
word of ripe experience, you know, Kitty, my dear,
I feel that we are privileged, indeed!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Thus Miss Almeria, bending her stately head in emphasis.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So you <i>will</i> come, Kitty darling, won&#39;t you?&quot;
begged Miss Egeria; &quot;at least think it over well; we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page66" id="page66"></a>[pg&nbsp;66]</span>
feel that we have as much claim as any of the friends,
and&mdash;perhaps&mdash;I cannot help feeling, my love, as
if our dear departed Saint might have wished&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But!&quot; cried Kitty, again, as after promising gratefully
to think it over, she took her way to Cheeseman&#39;s,
&quot;the dear, kind, darling things! Nobody seems to
realize that I have come home, to my own house!&quot;</p>

<p class="h2">CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="smcap">johanna ex machina</span></p>

<p class="indent">Kitty had her dinner alone, for Nelly Chanter&#39;s
school was at some distance.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Besides,&quot; said Sarepta, &quot;I only asked her to
come for breakfast and supper and nights. You&#39;d
want <i>some</i> time to yourself, I told her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Sarepta stood in the doorway, her hands folded in
her apron, while Kitty ate her excellent little dinner
soberly and thoughtfully. She had no idea of slighting
Sarepta&#39;s cookery; she had a good appetite, and
even if she hadn&#39;t, there must be no hurting of feelings.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sarepta!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The pudding is delicious, Sarepta! And&mdash;they all
want me to come and live with them!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;H&#39;m!&quot; Sarepta&#39;s sniff was eloquent. Kitty went
on, crumbling her bread thoughtfully:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Madam Flynt, Judge Peters, the Miss Bygoods,
the Chanters&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She smiled, still hearing the affectionate shouts and
shrieks of that friendly circle, still seeing the dining-room
where she had found them all, Mrs. Chanter
ladling out chowder, beaming on her clamorous brood,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68"></a>[pg&nbsp;68]</span>
Mr. Chanter with half an eye on his plate, and one
and a half on the dog&#39;s-eared Thucydides beside him.
How affectionate they were; what good friends!
&quot;And Mr. Mallow wants me to keep house for him,
Sarepta; think of it! Why, he has always said he
wouldn&#39;t have any woman gormineering over him;
ever since I can remember he has said that. And now
he thinks he would be as comfortable as old Tilley if
I would come and be his lady housekeeper! Who was
old Tilley, Sarepta?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Some other old fool, I expect!&quot; Sarepta was very
grim. &quot;If you asked me, I should say Marsh Mallow
was a little wantin&#39;. The idea!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The funny thing is, none of them seems to realize
that I have a home of my own! Isn&#39;t it funny,
Sarepta? So dear and kind, every one of them&mdash;why,
I am so full of gratefulness I couldn&#39;t hold any more!&mdash;but
how <i>can</i> they think I would leave my own dear
darling home?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Sarepta Darwin drew a long breath, and blinked
fiercely. If it had been any one but Sarepta, one would
have said there were tears in those pale blue eyes, but
of course Sarepta never shed tears.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then you calc&#39;late to stay on here!&quot; she spoke
dryly, but there was something in her tone that made
Kitty look up quickly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, Sarepta, of course I do! What else should
I do! Don&#39;t be a goose, Sarepta dear!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She got up and gave Sarepta a little hug: she might
as well have hugged the door for all outward response,
but that did not matter.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page69" id="page69"></a>[pg&nbsp;69]</span>
&quot;Who&mdash;<i>what</i> is that, Sarepta?&quot; she demanded, as
a figure came up the path. &quot;It looks like a postman!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Is! we&#39;ve had d&#39;liv&#39;ry for a year past!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There was exultation in Sarepta&#39;s voice. Next to
the well-being of Ross House and its inmates, she
lived for the greater glory of Cyrus.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, it&#39;s Bingo!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Kitty was at the front door in a flash, greeting a
highly embarrassed youth in gray uniform. &quot;Bingo,
how do you do? To think of your being postman!
How splendid!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pleased to see you!&quot; muttered Adolphus Evander
Byng, who had never had any benefit of his fine name,
but was called Addy Evy for long and Bingo for short,
as Tom used to say. &quot;Hope I see you well. Letter
for you! Goo&#39;day!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Thus Bingo, hurling himself away from the door,
as if he had not been looking forward all day to this
moment; as if he had not solemnly promised his Aunt
Miny, who &quot;dressmade&quot; as we say in Cyrus, to notice
every single thing Kitty Ross had on, coming straight
from Paris that way. There was a painful scene that
evening at the Byng cottage. Gray dress? Well,
what kind of a gray dress? Was it silk, or wool, or
melange? Did it do up behind? Was it made D&#39;rectory?
Was there gores in the skirt? Here Addy Evy
fled to the barn, and his Aunt Miny did think he was
real mean; she despised any one who hadn&#39;t eyes in his
head, be he man or woman: there!</p>

<p class="indent">Kitty came back with her letter, turning it over, as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id="page70"></a>[pg&nbsp;70]</span>
people do, before opening it. A large square envelope,
superscribed in a stiff, official-looking hand.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;From Aunt Johanna!&quot; she said. &quot;It is surely her
hand. I wonder&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She opened the letter; read it; looked up with a
dazed expression at Sarepta, who was lingering by the
door with an air of elaborate detachment.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, Sarepta! why&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Well</i>,&quot; Sarepta&#39;s tone was incisive, to say the least.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It has been delayed!&quot; Kitty looked at the envelope.
&quot;Missent to &#39;Cyrene&#39;! I should think so. Why,
Sarepta, this was written a week ago! She&#39;s coming
to-day!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who&#39;s comin&#39;? Not Johanna Ross?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes!&quot; Kitty rose in agitation and began instinctively
straightening everything in the room.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You no need to do <i>that</i>!&quot; Sarepta spoke grimly,
with looks to match. &quot;I went to school with Johanna
Ross. She comin&#39; to-day, you say? How long she
goin&#39; to stay?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She says&mdash;I&#39;ll read it to you.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&quot;<span class="smcap">My Dear Kitty</span>,</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am retiring from business and should like to make you a visit if agreeable. Ask Sarepta to find a young girl to take care of me. Unless otherwise advised, expect me at 2.30 Saturday P. M.</p>

<p class ="right">&quot;Affectionately yours,<br />
Johanna Ross</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sarepta, it&#39;s two o&#39;clock now! What room shall
we put her in? I can&#39;t think&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page71" id="page71"></a>[pg&nbsp;71]</span>
Kitty&#39;s voice was trembling, her cheeks flushed.
Seeing this, Sarepta assumed her dryest manner and
tone.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Put her in the Red Injun room. It&#39;s all ready: I
cleaned it last week.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course!&quot; Kitty&#39;s brow lightened. &quot;Clever
Sarepta! The Red Indian room will be <i>just</i> the thing.
Let&#39;s come up and look at it! Of course it&#39;s all right,
but actually I haven&#39;t been in it. Why, I haven&#39;t
been here two days, Sarepta!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Her voice quivered again, but she mastered it, and
hurried upstairs with Sarepta close behind her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I wouldn&#39;t let Johanna Ross put me out,&quot; Sarepta
remarked, apparently addressing the stair-rail, &quot;not for
one quarter of a second.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Kitty made no reply. Sarepta, who certainly was
&quot;no canny,&quot; Kitty often thought, appeared to read her
thought through the back of her head.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you needn&#39;t be scared,&quot; she went on. &quot;I know
my place. I&#39;m just freein&#39; my mind, so to speak. I
went to school with Johanna, and I know her like a
book. She&#39;s a fine woman in spots, and she&#39;s Doctor&#39;s
sister. I know my place, and she knows hers; you no
need to be scared.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Kitty turned and flashed such a look of mingled relief
and thankfulness that Sarepta almost stumbled.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Go on up!&quot; she said austerely.</p>

<p class="indent">Before ever I saw the Red Indian room, I used
to think&mdash;hearing it casually mentioned by Kitty or
Tom&mdash;it was in some way connected with the North
American Indians. I used to wonder about it: whether
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72"></a>[pg&nbsp;72]</span>
it were shaped and furnished like a wigwam; whether
Indians had ever lived in it; whether&mdash;dreadful
thought, born of too-early reading of Parkman&#39;s histories&mdash;there
had been a Massacre there! I remember
that when Kitty proposed a visit to it one day, as being
the most convenient way of attaining the barn roof, I
inwardly shrank and cowered, dreading what might
meet my eyes. The relief of the first glance is still
with me.</p>

<p class="indent">Dr. Ross&#39;s grandfather had been a sea-captain, and
had brought home from China a wonderful toilet set
of Red India china. There it was, still perfect, not
so much as a cover broken; there it is to-day, I trust.
The room had been furnished to match the set, with
hangings and cushions, bedspread, etcetera, of Eastern
cotton, almost the exact shade of warm dull red; the
chairs were lacquered in the same tint. An enchanting
room! And its possibilities! Not only did one
of its windows give access to the barn roof, but the
little red-lacquered door beside the fireplace opened
upon the Secret Staircase, the pride of Kitty&#39;s heart,
the envy of every other child in Cyrus. A little winding,
breakneck stair, burrowing down in the thickness
of the chimney casing. You could come out in the sitting-room
if you wished, but we never did; the staircase
burrowed still further downward, and the cellar
was far more exciting.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Twill suit with Johanna&#39;s looks!&quot; said Sarepta,
after a critical survey of the room. &quot;Come to think
of it, I believe she had this room when she was a
gal. It&#39;ll be real handy for her, bathroom and all to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page73" id="page73"></a>[pg&nbsp;73]</span>
herself, and no need to bother you. Yes, I expect
she&#39;ll like it. Hark!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The sound of wheels. Kitty fled down the stairs,
Sarepta scuttling behind her as fast as dignity allowed,
and threw open the front door.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Aunt Johanna! Come in! come in! How good of
you to come!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you wish I hadn&#39;t, eh? Never mind, Kitty!
Will John Tucker see to my trunks? How are you,
Sarepta?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Johanna Ross might be forty-five, but looked
younger. A tall, fine figure of a woman, with dark
eyes and hair, the former of a singularly piercing
quality. Kitty felt, she told Nelly Chanter afterward,
as if at the first glance her spinal marrow had been
investigated. She was handsomely and fashionably
dressed, and carried a satchel of the latest mode. Her
voice was deep-toned, her speech as incisive as
Sarepta&#39;s own, her gestures and carriage impressive.
Such was the lady who now confronted Kitty in the
sitting room.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You got my letter last week?&quot; she said. &quot;Has
Sarepta got a young woman for me?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, Aunt Johanna. The letter was missent, you
see: it only came an hour ago.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Missent? Inexcusable! I&#39;ll write to the Post Office
Department. Well! I may as well explain matters
at once, Kitty; Sarepta, you&#39;d better wait a minute,
as this concerns you also.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Ross sat down on the leather sofa, and looked
thoughtfully from Kitty to Sarepta, and back again.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74"></a>[pg&nbsp;74]</span>
&quot;I haven&#39;t been here for twenty years,&quot; she said. &quot;I
am actually glad I came!&quot; She seemed surprised at
this, and pondered a moment. Sarepta sniffed slightly:
Kitty was silent, hardly knowing what to say.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have retired from business,&quot; Miss Ross went on
in a clear, explanatory voice, &quot;because I am tired. I
intend to take to my bed&mdash;What is it?&quot; She paused:
Kitty had uttered a cry of surprise.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nothing, Aunt Johanna. Did I understand&mdash;are
you ill, Aunt Johanna?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not in the least. I have never been ill in my life,
except for measles at the age of five. I tell you I am
tired, and I intend to take to my bed. For twenty
years,&quot; Miss Ross went on, still more explanatorily,
&quot;I have been Rug and Tapestry Expert for Kostly and
Richmore:&quot; she named one of the great houses of
New York. &quot;During these twenty years I have been
on my feet all day, and often half the night. I have
now retired&mdash;on a competence&mdash;and, as I said before,
I intend to take to my bed. I am used to wholesale
ways,&quot; she added with a smile. &quot;I have worked in
a wholesale way; now I mean to rest in a wholesale
way. Have you found me a maid, Sarepta?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Land sakes!&quot; cried Sarepta, throwing her hands
out in indignant protest. &quot;Why, it ain&#39;t an hour since
we heard you was coming!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;True!&quot; Miss Ross paused and considered. &quot;Well!
I suppose you can find me one?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I dunno as I can, and I dunno <i>as</i> I can!&quot; replied
Sarepta cautiously. &quot;What do you want of her, Miss
Ross?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page75" id="page75"></a>[pg&nbsp;75]</span>
Miss Ross laughed outright, a merry laugh which
somehow transformed her rather sharp face.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To take care of me, Miss Darwin! You don&#39;t
suppose I expected you to take care of me, do you?
Find me a young girl, whom I can order about, and
send on errands and bully, and throw things at. I
couldn&#39;t throw the bolster at you, Miss Darwin!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You might try!&quot; Sarepta replied with a grim
chuckle, and a distinct softening of the frosty manner
which had been upon her ever since the visitor entered.
She looked at Kitty. &quot;Jenny Tucker might do!&quot; she
said doubtfully. &quot;She&#39;s sixteen, and takes after her
father more than the rest.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Jenny! That&#39;s a good name to call,&quot; Miss Ross
nodded approvingly. &quot;John Tucker&#39;s daughter, is
she? That&#39;s good, too. John and I were always
friends. Is she pretty?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pretty enough, I guess.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Then send for her, will you? I won&#39;t go to bed
now, Kitty. You shall come and help me unpack, and
we&#39;ll have supper together&mdash;if Miss Darwin approves&mdash;&mdash;&quot;
she threw a quizzical glance at Sarepta,
who gave a snort and vanished&mdash;&quot;and a cosy evening
by the fire. You shall tell me everything you like,
my dear, and nothing you don&#39;t like, and at ten o&#39;clock
I shall go to bed and stay there.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Aunt Johanna&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, my dear! How delightful this room is! What
is it, Kitty?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you mean&mdash;do you think of taking a <i>long</i> rest,
or only a few days?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page76" id="page76"></a>[pg&nbsp;76]</span>
&quot;One year!&quot; said Miss Ross crisply. Kitty gasped.
&quot;That is, if I find it suits me. Six months anyhow,
to give it a full trial. That seems sensible, eh?&quot; She
looked up sharply. &quot;Eh?&quot; she repeated.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I&mdash;suppose so!&quot; stammered Kitty. &quot;Only&mdash;it
seems a very long time, Aunt Johanna. You see,
I have never been ill.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nor tired!&quot; Miss Ross spoke in short, sharp jerks,
throwing up her chin with each remark. &quot;You think
you have been tired, but you haven&#39;t. I tell you, <i>the
marrow is withered in my bones</i>. You say I don&#39;t
look it, and I don&#39;t; every one says so. Last month,
one of our partners asked me to open a branch in
Nijninovgorod; said I looked strong enough for that
or anything. Last week,&quot; this astonishing lady went
on, &quot;another of &#39;em asked me to marry him, because I
looked as if I could take good care of him. That settled
it! &#39;I&#39;ll take to my bed!&#39; says I; and here I am.
Well! that&#39;s enough about me. Now about you! Poor
little White Rose couldn&#39;t stay any longer, could she?
No! not to be expected. She couldn&#39;t live without
John; she had merged her existence in his, you see.
You did all you could, and the look you have of John
probably kept her alive till now; but it couldn&#39;t last.
No! So here you are, with Sarepta and John Tucker&mdash;and
me!&quot; she added with a sharp, quizzical glance.
&quot;What are your ideas? What are your plans? Is
there any money left?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Kitty told her quietly what there was: told, too, of
Sarepta&#39;s and John Tucker&#39;s earnings and of the proposed
partnership with the latter. She found it singularly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id="page77"></a>[pg&nbsp;77]</span>
easy to talk to this relative whom she had
hitherto known so slightly and seen so seldom. Miss
Ross sat bolt upright on the sofa, listening intently,
nodding emphatic approval from time to time.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Excellent!&quot; she said, when Kitty had finished her
story. &quot;Admirable! With my board money and your
earnings, you ought to be able to lay by, my dear.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Aunt Johanna!&quot; Kitty lifted a shocked face.
&quot;I couldn&#39;t&mdash;you mustn&#39;t think of such a thing. Why,
this is your own home, where you were born! Why
should you pay board here?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Little goose, why do you suppose I came here?
Why didn&#39;t I go to a Rest Cure? &#39;Because,&#39; I said,
&#39;why pay good money to strangers and harpies when
I can pay it to my own lawful niece in my own&mdash;not
precisely lawful, because it belongs to her&mdash;but my
natural home?&#39; Enough about that. Besides, there
was another reason. I wanted to <i>do what I wanted</i>,
Kitty! For twenty years I have lived in a mold,
worked in a mold, spoken in a mold, smiled in a
mold. Now the mold is broken. I want to be able,
if I feel like it, to fling open all the windows in this
house&mdash;there are forty of them, I believe&mdash;and scream
out of each one. Can you understand that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perfectly!&quot; cried Kitty kindling.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Exactly! You are a Ross, I see. Well! I shall
not be likely to do that, because I shall be in my bed;
but if I did, or whatever I might do, the neighbors
would just say, &#39;Johanna! always peculiar!&#39; and there
would be an end of it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page78" id="page78"></a>[pg&nbsp;78]</span>
&quot;Aunt Johanna!&quot; Kitty came and sat down by her
aunt. &quot;Do you know what I think?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, my dear, unless you think I am mad. I&#39;m not,
only a bit cracked, like most people.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I think you are a dear! I think&mdash;I should like to
give you a hug!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Suiting the action to the word, Kitty threw her arms
round her aunt, who returned the embrace heartily.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good little girl!&quot; she said, and her clear emphatic
voice was rather husky. &quot;Nice little girl! We shall
get on famously together.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And&mdash;&quot; Kitty&#39;s eyes were opening very wide, as
they always did when a new idea dawned upon her.
&quot;Why, Aunt Johanna, you are just like all the rest,
only reversed.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do you mean, Kitty? Speak English,
child!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, every one in the village, all the dear friends
and neighbors, want me to come and live with them.
Madam Flynt, Judge Peters, Miss Bygoods, the Chanters&mdash;and
Mr. Mallow&quot;&mdash;Kitty broke into a little
crow of laughter&mdash;&quot;wants me to be his housekeeper
and matron! Well! and now you come, with the
same dear wish to help me, at the other end. And,
<i>oh</i>!&quot; Kitty, jumping up, clapped her hands and actually
began to dance, &quot;Don&#39;t you <i>see</i>, Aunt Johanna,
here is my answer to them all. They were all <i>so</i> kind,
and so urgent, I didn&#39;t know <i>what</i> to say to them,
though of course nothing would have induced me to
leave my dear darling home. But now, don&#39;t you see,
I <i>can&#39;t</i> go to any of them, because of&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page79" id="page79"></a>[pg&nbsp;79]</span>
&quot;Because of bedridden aunt! Precisely. <i>Johanna
ex machina.</i> I learned my Latin of Mr. Bygood, my
dear; he taught at the Academy when I was a girl.
Well! so <i>that</i> is all settled. They all wanted my little
niece, eh? And I&#39;ve stolen a march on &#39;em. Ha! ha!
and now, Kitty, I should like to see my room and unpack
a bit. I thought possibly, my dear, you might
spare me the Red Indian room, which used to be mine,
but I can sleep anywhere.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is all ready for you!&quot; cried Kitty joyously.
&quot;Oh, Aunt Johanna, you <i>are</i> a dear, and you really
belong, and I am so happy!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The last band snapped from Kitty&#39;s heart, and she
led the way joyously upstairs.</p>

<p class="h2">CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="smcap">a symposium</span></p>

<p class="indent">It was Wednesday, Ladies&#39; Night at the Mallow
House. For many years, Mrs. Wibird and Melissa,
and the Misses Bygood had supped with
Mr. Mallow on Wednesday evening. It was the
&quot;help&#39;s&quot; evening out, and the boarders understood that
they must sup elsewhere that night. Mr. Mallow invariably
cooked the supper, the Wibirds assisting,
Mrs. Wibird and Melissa eagerly, Wilson grudgingly.
After the delightful little meal, always perfectly
cooked and served, Mr. Mallow would take off his
coat, roll up his immaculate shirtsleeves, and wash
the dishes, the ladies wiping them daintily. Other
neighbors would often drop in after supper; it was a
pleasant and friendly occasion.</p>

<p class="indent">Supper was over now, the dishes washed and put
away, and the company gathered in Mr. Mallow&#39;s sitting
room, a cheerful apartment, with a general aspect
of chenille and &quot;tidies,&quot; further brightened by a crackling
wood fire on the hearth. They were hemming
what Mr. Mallow called &quot;wipers,&quot; more generally
known as dish or glass towels. Mr. Mallow sat in
the middle, a large basket balanced on his knees. He
sewed slowly and carefully, using a long thread, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page81" id="page81"></a>[pg&nbsp;81]</span>
Melissa threaded for him, as he was wont to explain
that &quot;he was no camel, and could not go through a
needle&#39;s eye.&quot; This was a wonderful joke, and never
failed to send a ripple of genteel mirth through the
assembled ladies. Mrs. Wibird and Melissa worked
with bird-like, darting motions, swift but irregular,
dropping their work whenever they spoke, which was
very often. The Misses Bygood worked even more
swiftly, and with perfect steadiness and grace.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This is an elegant piece of goods, Marsh!&quot; said
Mrs. Wibird. &quot;Better than the last, &#39;pears to me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So fine and smooth!&quot; Miss Egeria cooed softly.
&quot;It is a pleasure to work on it, Mr. Mallow.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Tis good goods!&quot; Mr. Mallow assented. &quot;Pure
linen, not a fibre of cotton in it. I have to have my
wipers good. Some things you can squinch on, others
you can&#39;t; I am thrifty, but I do have to have my
wipers good. And plenty!&quot; he added. &quot;A moisty
wiper gives me the creeps, it so does. There! I should
like to have a clean one for every dish.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A gentle murmur arose, as of highly commending
bees.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Such a profusion!&quot; said Miss Almeria.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So agreeable,&quot; chimed in Miss Egeria, &quot;to be able
always to use a dry one. I assure you we greatly
appreciate it, Mr. Mallow.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Mallow beamed and made a little bow over his
&quot;wiper,&quot; thereby pricking his finger: a crimson drop
appeared and fell on the shining linen. Then what a
commotion! Melissa flew for water and a &quot;cot.&quot;
Mrs. Wibird, who could not bear the sight of blood,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page82" id="page82"></a>[pg&nbsp;82]</span>
prepared to faint, but thought better of it, the first red
drop being also the last. Miss Almeria and Miss
Egeria murmured sympathy, and proffered their own
fine handkerchiefs. Mr. Mallow, with manly stoicism,
declared that it was &quot;Nothin&#39; at all! nothin&#39; at all!
Gives a chance to show that my blood is good and red.
None of these white corp&#39;scles they talk about nowadays.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ve heard of them!&quot; said Mrs. Wibird. &quot;Something
to do with corpses, are they?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I presume likely!&quot; Mr. Mallow replied, with reserve.
&quot;Ahem! not a subject for ladies, perhaps.
Sorry I mentioned &#39;em.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Have you seen our dear Kitty to-day, Mr. Mallow?&quot;
asked Miss Almeria, tactfully, seeing his brow
clouded. He had a great deal of delicacy, Mr. Mallow;
all Cyrus gentlemen had, she thought gratefully.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, &#39;m! yes, I have seen her. I hoped&mdash;I asked
Kitty to join us this evening, but she was degaged.
How are you, Very? Come in! come in! Take a
seat! Glad to see you!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Jordano entered, bowing right and left with
his best Italian air.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Grazier, Marshall!&quot; he replied urbanely. &quot;Grazier,
I&#39;m sure! Good-evening, ladies! Miss Bygood&mdash;Miss
Egeria&mdash;Mrs. Wibird&mdash;Miss Melissa&quot;&mdash;a separate
bow for each lady, but Miss Almeria&#39;s was the lowest&mdash;&quot;your
humble servant!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We&#39;re having us a sewing-bee!&quot; Mr. Mallow announced,
beaming over his basket. &quot;I don&#39;t know
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83"></a>[pg&nbsp;83]</span>
as you&#39;d care to join us, Very. I never saw you handle
a needle. I&#39;ve just wownded myself, long as I&#39;ve ben
at it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, grazier! grazier!&quot; fluttered Mr. Jordano.
(This word was a new acquisition; the good gentleman
could not resist flourishing it as if it were a specially
fine and clean pocket handkerchief. If you had
asked its meaning, he would have explained kindly
that it was the Italian word for &quot;thanks!&quot;) &quot;I fear I
should make but a poor hand at needlework, Marshall.
A&mdash;a most graceful and feminine accomplishment,&quot;
he bowed round the circle of ladies, &quot;and one
I always watch with delight-tite-tite: but I think I will
remain a spectator.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He drew a chair into the circle, and took out his
notebook.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Any items for the Scribe?&quot; he asked blandly.
&quot;After the excitement of last week&mdash;I allude to the
return of Miss Katharine Ross to her native heath, if
I may quote the Wizard of the North&mdash;the town has
been unusually quiet, and promised to be equally so
to-day-tay-tay; but&mdash;a&mdash;there was another arrival this
afternoon.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Indeed!&quot; the ladies exclaimed. &quot;Who&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am not aware!&quot; Mr. Jordano waved his notebook
in some agitation. &quot;I hoped to find information here,
to tell the truth. A distang lady&mdash;oh, very distang
indeed&mdash;quite unknown to me. I failed in my endeavor
to interrogate John Tucker; his movements are
so extremely quick-wick-wick!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He looked anxiously from one face to another;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>[pg&nbsp;84]</span>
the ladies returned his look with another equally anxious.
Mr. Mallow, however, nodded importantly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes!&quot; he said. &quot;I was just goin&#39; to tell the ladies
when you come in, Very. I had asked Kitty to join
us here this evening, but she is kept at home by a
visitor. Ahem!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Mallow was too human not to enjoy prolonging
the suspense a moment; he was too kind to prolong it
further.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Johanna Ross!&quot; he announced explosively. &quot;I <i>was</i>
surprised!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Johanna Ross!</i>&quot; all the ladies cried out in chorus.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, I never did!&quot; Mrs. Wibird further elucidated
the situation.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How unexpected!&quot; said Miss Almeria gravely.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yet not unnatural, sister!&quot; Miss Egeria murmured
gently. &quot;Kitty&#39;s own aunt, you know!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am fully aware of that, my love!&quot; Miss Almeria
bent her head with dignity. &quot;Nothing could be more
natural, under ordinary circumstances; but Johanna
is&mdash;peculiar, I am obliged to say.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I never could get over her not comin&#39; to Doctor&#39;s
funeral!&quot; Mrs. Wibird lamented. &quot;I was brought up
with Johanna, but I never could get over that. And
that message she sent! They were takin&#39; stock, and
John would understand. I hope he did, for I&#39;m sure
nobody else did.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Wibird gave a shiver of reprehension, and set
her thin lips. She was a forlorn little lady, the opposite
in every way of her brother. Marshall Mallow
would have looked&mdash;and been&mdash;well nourished on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page85" id="page85"></a>[pg&nbsp;85]</span>
bread and cheese, if he had enough of it. Marcia
Mallow had always looked, as Mrs. Sharpe expressed
it, like the thin end of a pea-pod, and the most generous
diet never added a pound to the ninety-nine she
owned to. Melissa had tried more than once to &quot;flesh
her up,&quot; without success. But then, &quot;they&quot; said she
gave all the nice things her brother sent her to &quot;that
Wilson.&quot; Melissa always looked hungry, too; even
to-night, after that excellent lobster supper. Cyrus
collectively hoped that that Wilson would get his
come-uppance some day. Melissa Wibird would be a
pretty girl if she didn&#39;t look starved.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Has she come to stay, think?&quot; asked Mrs. Wibird.
&quot;Did Kitty say, Marsh? What <i>did</i> she say?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She just said she was sorry she couldn&#39;t come, her
Aunt Johanna had arrived.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And you didn&#39;t <i>ask</i> her whether she was comin&#39;
to stay? Now, Marshall!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A&mdash;if I may venture a conjecture&quot;&mdash;Mr. Jordano
waved his notebook with a gesture expressive
of deprecatory delicacy&mdash;&quot;the lady in question would
appear to intend to pass some time in our&mdash;shall I say
midst? Her trunks&mdash;four of them&mdash;were of ample
size. I should hardly suppose that for a brief sojourn&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She&#39;s come to stay!&quot; Mrs. Wibird ejaculated positively;
the Misses Bygood bent their heads and murmured,
&quot;she has doubtless come to stay!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So there&#39;s an end to my fine projectile!&quot; said Mr.
Mallow, with a sigh. Then in answer to inquiring
looks:</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page86" id="page86"></a>[pg&nbsp;86]</span>
&quot;A projectile&mdash;a plan I had. I thought maybe
Kitty would come and keep house for me; asked her,
in fact. She promised to think it over; but, of course,
there&#39;s an end of it now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, Marshall!&quot; Mrs. Wibird prepared to shed
tears. &quot;You know Melissa and I would come <i>any</i>
time to keep house for you: you know I have offered
to, over and over again, but you always said&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Never mind, mother!&quot; Melissa broke in. &quot;That
was different! I understand entirely, Uncle Marsh.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Mallow had been winking both eyes rapidly, a
sign of embarrassment with him. He was very good
to his sister, and really fond of Melissa, poor child,
but&mdash;well, Lissy understood!</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A singular coincidence!&quot; Miss Egeria fluttered into
the breach. &quot;Sister and I had also hoped&mdash;had asked
dear Kitty to make her home with us, Mr. Mallow.
Of course we had no idea&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why,&quot; cried Melissa, &quot;the Chanters expected her
to live with them, Zephine told me so this very morning.
The boys are going to move into the barn chamber,
and the girls into their room, so Kitty can have
<i>their</i> room, the girls&#39;. They spoke as if it were all
settled.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Miss Kitty is in great demand: in great demand!
Grando demando, as we say in Italy. I happen to
know for a fact that Madam Flynt had made a similar
plan for Miss Kitty&#39;s future. I had the honor of calling
upon that estimable lady this afternoon, and she
said quite confidently that she expected our young
friend to take up her abode&mdash;in short, to share her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>[pg&nbsp;87]</span>
elegant mansion with her. Miss Kitty had promised
to think it over, but Madam Flynt appeared to have little
doubt-tout-tout&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I must say I think Kitty has been rather sly!&quot; said
Mrs. Wibird, compressing her thin lips. &quot;It&#39;s all very
well to keep your own counsel, but there is such a thing
as being too close-mouthed, to <i>my</i> mind!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, mother!&quot; protested Melissa. &quot;You&#39;re entirely
mistaken!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No doubt!&quot; Mrs. Wibird folded her hands meekly.
&quot;I am usually mistaken, I admit; still I have my
opinions, poor as they are.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It was Miss Almeria who spoke now, with quiet
dignity. &quot;I do not understand, Marcia, that Kitty
has done more in any case than agree to think over the
invitation received by her. It seems to me in every
way proper that she should do so. On the whole&mdash;&mdash;&quot;
Miss Almeria paused, to give weight to her words,
&quot;on the whole, sadly as we are disappointed, my sister
and I rejoice, I am sure, that matters have so arranged
themselves that Kitty can remain in her own
home. We have not intended to be selfish, friends and
neighbors, but we may have been so unconsciously.
Kitty is tenderly attached to her own home; I for one
am surprised that I did not realize this more fully. It
seemed&mdash;it would have been such a pleasure to have
her&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dear child!&quot; murmured Miss Egeria. &quot;It would
indeed! but you are perfectly right, sister!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Doubtless Johanna realized this situation. I applaud,
though I deplore in certain aspects, her action.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88"></a>[pg&nbsp;88]</span>
All through Miss Almeria&#39;s address, pronounced
with much dignity, Mr. Jordano had been making little
bows of admiring approbation. When she paused,
he took up the word eagerly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Applause is doubtless indicated, Miss Almeria. I&mdash;a&mdash;heartily
agree; heartily! A&mdash;would it be permissible
for me to ask&mdash;I am not aware that Miss
Ross has visited Cyrus during the years of my sojourn
here&mdash;&quot; (Mr. Jordano came from Tinkham,
but, as every one said, he was not responsible for that,
and he came away the very moment he was grown
up)&mdash;&quot;a&mdash;a&mdash;in short, are there any items that you
would feel at liberty to communicate to the Scribe?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There was a silence. Cyrus loves to talk, but there
are some subjects on which it is reserved. Johanna
Ross is one of them. All looked at Miss Almeria, who
was turning a hem with exquisite nicety. She felt
the look and responded, a slight flush rising to her
smooth cheek.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Miss Ross is a native of Cyrus,&quot; she said, &quot;but has
not lived here for many years. Twenty, I think, sister?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Twenty!&quot; assented Miss Egeria; there was a general
confirmatory murmur.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She is a person of marked abilities, and has always
felt&mdash;I believe&mdash;that Cyrus did not afford sufficient
scope for these abilities. She has occupied a responsible
position in a large establishment&mdash;wholesale&mdash;in
the city of New York. This has absorbed all her time
and energies; she has not felt&mdash;until now&mdash;that Cyrus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>[pg&nbsp;89]</span>
had any claim upon them. May I trouble you for the
eighty cotton, Mr. Mallow?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Certingly! certingly, Miss Bygood!&quot; Mr. Mallow,
in his haste to comply with the request, upset his big
basket, and spools, tape, buttons, flew in every direction.
How the ladies flew after them! How gracefully
Miss Egeria glided in pursuit of the big spool of
linen thread! how majestically Miss Almeria bent to
capture the flood of buttons that poured into her silken
lap! how Mrs. Wibird pounced, and Melissa hopped
and fluttered! As for Mr. Jordano, he had an encounter
with a skein of darning cotton, and entangled himself
with it in a quite unbelievable way, and had to
be rescued by Miss Egeria. It was a most exciting incident;
they spoke of it for weeks after. Mr. Mallow,
meantime, sat with the overturned basket still on
his knees, grasping it tight, as if he feared it would
follow the rest, and ejaculating, &quot;My! my! I <i>am</i> surprised!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I make my &#39;pologies!&quot; he said finally, when the
last button had been restored to its place. &quot;I make
my &#39;pologies, ladies! I don&#39;t know as I ever did such
a thing before. Quite a cat&#39;s trophy, I&#39;m sure.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Flushed and breathless with agitation and vicarious
exertion, the good gentleman took up his work again,
but uttered an exclamation of discomfiture. &quot;There!
I&#39;ve unthreaded my needle. Lissy, you know what I
say; I&#39;m no dromedary&mdash;I would say camel! Thread
it for me, will you, dearie?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">While the threading was in process, Miss Almeria
was advising with Mr. Jordano in low tones, as to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page90" id="page90"></a>[pg&nbsp;90]</span>
the precise wording of the item which was to reveal
to Cyrus at large the advent of Miss Johanna Ross.
He had already, the evening before, submitted to her
his account of Kitty&#39;s arrival, a piece of writing of
which he was modestly proud. It began, &quot;Flushed
with oriflammes was the western sky, and Old Sol
still shed his cheering ray over Cyrus and environs&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At this moment the door flew open, and Mrs. Sharpe
appeared, with Cissy close behind her. Well! they <i>did</i>
look like an old vixen and a young one, there was no
doubt about it, though of course Tom ought not to
have said it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good-evenin&#39;, all!&quot; Mrs. Sharpe was panting, as
if she had hurried. &quot;I thought I&#39;d make a run-in: I
calc&#39;lated I should find you here, Almeria &#39;n&#39; Egeria.
I want to know if you&#39;ve heard&mdash;&mdash;&quot; her voice failed
her, and she sat down, fanning herself with the
&quot;cloud&quot; she had pulled off her head. &quot;I hastened too
much,&quot; she panted. &quot;I got to get my breath!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t know as anybody&#39;s in a hurry, Mis&#39;
Sharpe!&quot; Mr. Mallow&#39;s tone was less cordial than
usual. He did not like Mrs. Sharpe, or her &quot;run-ins.&quot;
He didn&#39;t see, he had confided to Miss Egeria, why a
person should have no privation just because he
thought fit to keep a hotel. &quot;It isn&#39;t as if she was a
guest,&quot; he said, &quot;paying or invited.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The rest of the company regarded the newcomers
with mingled disfavor and curiosity.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is it, Cissy?&quot; Mrs. Wibird asked, the latter
sentiment overcoming the former.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page91" id="page91"></a>[pg&nbsp;91]</span>
&quot;Why,&quot; began Cissy, nothing loth; &quot;Miss Johanna&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now you hush up, Cissy!&quot; said her mother, sharply.
&quot;You told over to Jebuses, and I&#39;m going to tell
here. Johanna Ross has come home!&quot; she announced,
with an air of dramatic triumph. &quot;She came this
afternoon. I saw her with these eyes.&quot; She indicated
a pair&mdash;well, perhaps not exactly a pair&mdash;of yellowish
eyes, decidedly too near together for beauty.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We are aware of that!&quot; replied Mr. Mallow majestically.
Sitting with his needle poised in air, his
knees rather wide apart, to support the big basket
firmly and prevent further &quot;cat&#39;s trophy,&quot; he looked
like a mild and rosy Rhadamanthus about to give judgment.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, you are! Some one got ahead of me!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Sharpe darted a suspicious glance round the
friendly circle.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, do you know what she is up to? That&mdash;that
<i>stay-away</i>&mdash;her that Cyrus isn&#39;t good enough for, that
wouldn&#39;t attend her own brother&#39;s funeral because she
was too stuck-up&mdash;do you know what has come to her
in judgment? She has come back to Cyrus because
she was <i>obliged</i> to! she has come back to saddle herself
on her brother&#39;s child, that she has neglected ever
since she was born; she has <i>taken to her bed</i>, and there
she is to remain. Yes, Mr. Mallow! yes, girls! Mr.
Jordano, you can put it in the paper, if you&#39;re a mind
to. Miss Johanna Ross, the fine New York lady who
shook the dust of Cyrus off her feet, is a <i>bedridden
invalid</i>!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92"></a>[pg&nbsp;92]</span>
She gazed around with eager triumph, drinking in
the looks of dismay like wine.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A bedridden invalid!&quot; she repeated. &quot;What do
you think of that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Who told you this?&quot; asked Marshall Mallow abruptly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A&mdash;precisely!&quot; chimed in Mr. Jordano, in whom
incredulity and good feeling were wrestling with the
journalistic instinct. &quot;What ground, so to speak,
is there for this hypothesis-sis-sis?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mother heard her say so!&quot; Cissy hastened to put
in. &quot;Now, Mother, you might let me say a word!
She heard the telephone, and&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I thought &#39;twas our ring!&quot; cried Mrs. Sharpe. &quot;I
took up the receiver, and a <i>strange voice</i> was speakin&#39;.
I knew &#39;twas no one in Cyrus: I thought mebbe somethin&#39;
was wrong and I ought to notify the marshal.
And these words I heard: &#39;No, Madam Flynt, I&#39;m
sorry, but I can&#39;t come, because I am taking to my
bed, there to remain.&#39; And Madam Flynt said, &#39;Oh,
Johanna!&#39; <i>Then I knew!</i>&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Again, Mrs. Sharpe swept the circle with eager
eyes. She had made the sensation of her life and
was greedy of its sweets. But before any one could
respond a rustle of skirts arose outside, a hubbub of
voices, and in came The Boarders.</p>

<p class="indent">Some of the Boarders were ready enough to sup
&quot;outside&quot; on Wednesday evening. Mrs. Scatter and
her sister Miss Pringle went regularly to Judge
Peters&#39;s, and looked forward, and back, to it all the
week through. Not that the Judge&#39;s Mary was a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page93" id="page93"></a>[pg&nbsp;93]</span>
&quot;patch&quot; upon Mr. Mallow&#39;s Rosanna, but it made a
change, and there was always a sense of distinction in
supping with &quot;my cousin, the Judge.&quot; In the same
way, the Misses Caddie (Miss Pearl in the Bank,
Miss Ruby in the Telegraph Office) were glad and
proud of their weekly evening with Madam Flynt.
But it was hard on those who had no life-long ties
with Cyrus. Mr. and Mrs. Bagley (he traveled in
oil&mdash;mystic phrase&mdash;she worked in hair, and &quot;chiropodded,&quot;
as Mr. Mallow put it) had only been there
a matter of ten years, and they had no resource but
the Dew Drop Inn, a very inferior little hostelry down
by the station. It was harder still on the &quot;transients.&quot;
A tired bond salesman, let us say, just in from a long
journey, and looking forward to one of the famous
Mallow House suppers, was not pleased, after giving
up his bag and taking his key, to be told, &quot;No supper
to-night, sir!&quot; He might protest, in angry bewilderment,
asking if this called itself a hotel, etc., etc. It
made no difference: Billy had the one reply, &quot;Wednesday:
no supper, sir!&quot; If the angry guest still protested,
Mr. Mallow would come out of the office,
smiling and urbane. Very sorry, but it was a Rule of
the House. The Help, you see, their evening out;
they had to be considered, times like these. Dew
Drop Inn wasn&#39;t but a step; Billy would go down with
him and bespeak a good supper.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We&#39;ll make it up to you at breakfast!&quot; the guest
was cheerfully assured, as Mr. Mallow bowed him
toward the door, and this assurance was amply fulfilled.
Now and then a traveler called for his bag
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94"></a>[pg&nbsp;94]</span>
and went in a huff to spend the night at the Dew Drop
Inn; but he never did it twice.</p>

<p class="indent">Now, as I said, the Boarders were back, and rustling
in with a pleasant sense of home-coming. There
were two or three salesmen to-night, old customers,
who knew and accepted the Mallow House ways; they
were not Cyrus people, however, and it would have
been highly improper to continue the conversation
recently begun. Even the Sharpes realized this.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come on, Mother!&quot; whispered Cissy, pulling her
mother&#39;s shawl. &quot;You won&#39;t get another word in to-night!
They are just as glad, too, I can see that.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mother and daughter departed, and the others followed,
after a suitable interchange of greetings with
the newcomers. Wilson Wibird had come upstairs
with the Sharpes, and had been hanging about the
doorway, half curious, half sullen. He had been annoying
Billy all the evening in the office, and had
finally been dismissed by that apostle of silence, with
&quot;Go &#39;long! work to do!&quot; He resented having to
escort his mother and sister home, but there was no
choice, with Mr. Mallow&#39;s eye upon him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Here&#39;s Wilson, all ready!&quot; said the kindly potentate.
&quot;Wilse, you&#39;ll find a basket in the back entry
that Rosanny packed for your Ma. Take it along,
but be sure to bring it back in the morning; Rosanny
wants it. Good-night, Marshy; good-night, Lissy!
Sleep tighty, flea bitey!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Jordano, as was his custom, offered his escort
to the Misses Bygood, and they walked off together
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id="page95"></a>[pg&nbsp;95]</span>
in the fashion of other days, the gentleman giving an
arm to each.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A highly agreeable occasion!&quot; he said. &quot;Friend
Mallow is the ideal host-tost-tost.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He is indeed!&quot; said Miss Egeria, &quot;and it is so remarkable,
Mr. Jordano, for a lone man, so to speak,
to be such an excellent housekeeper. I am told that
the Mallow House is known far and wide as an ideal
hostelry. It is very gratifying to know that Cyrus
institutions (for the Mallow House is surely an institution)
rank so high throughout the State.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bello hotello! bello hotello,&quot; assented Mr. Jordano
warmly. &quot;House and host are well matched,
well matched. May I ask, Miss Bygood, if you attach
any&mdash;serious&mdash;a&mdash;importance to Mrs. Sharpe&#39;s&mdash;shall
I say singular statement?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Almeria pondered. &quot;It is hard to say!&quot; she
pronounced finally. &quot;The method by which the information
was obtained&mdash;but we will not speak of that!&quot;
she closed her eyes for a moment, as if to shut out
an unlovely vision. &quot;Miss Ross <i>is</i> peculiar: there is
no gainsaying that. She has always gone her own
way, with no guidance&mdash;that I am aware of&mdash;beyond
her own wishes. But she is a woman of character
and education, and I cannot for a moment believe that
matters are as&mdash;as we have heard them represented.
Doubtless we shall know all in good time. Meanwhile&mdash;may
I ask if you were contemplating the possibility
of altering or adding to your item, Mr. Jordano?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Jordano fluttered perceptibly.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page96" id="page96"></a>[pg&nbsp;96]</span>
&quot;Not if it would appear in any way unsuitable to a
lady&mdash;to ladies&quot;&mdash;with a little bow to Miss Egeria,
&quot;whose exquisite refinement of taste is equal to their&mdash;ahem!
shall I say, other characteristics? Not for
worlds, Miss Bygood, if you advise against it. At
the same time, if&mdash;if the information is to be&mdash;a&mdash;generally
disseminated, it might&mdash;the official organ&mdash;it
might be expected by the people&mdash;il Publico, you
understand-tand-tand&mdash;I will do whatever you advise,
Miss Bygood!&quot; the poor gentleman concluded.</p>

<p class="indent">It was heroic, though none of the three fully realized
it. To relinquish such a &quot;story,&quot; leave it to unofficial
babblers and&mdash;Mr. Jordano feared&mdash;spiteful
gossips, when it might be set down with gravity and
ornamented with flowers of speech&mdash;yes, it was heroic.
The two ladies thought it very nice of Mr. Jordano;
but they thought no more than that, and Miss Almeria
gave the <i>coup de grace</i> with unfaltering hand.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It will be best, I am convinced,&quot; she said, &quot;to
leave the item as it stood before Mrs. Sharpe&#39;s entrance.
I will say, her unseemly entrance. Your
own instinctive delicacy is so well known, Mr. Jordano&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh! grazier! grazier!&quot; murmured Mr. Jordano,
trying to bow gracefully, a difficult thing with a lady
on either arm&mdash;&quot;too much, Miss Almeria!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So well known,&quot; Miss Almeria repeated, with a
gracious bend of her own stately head, &quot;that all Cyrus
will appreciate your motive for abstaining from comment
upon what we have heard. If it proves true, we
shall know it soon enough; if false&mdash;&mdash;&quot; Miss Almeria&#39;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page97" id="page97"></a>[pg&nbsp;97]</span>
gesture was eloquent as well as dignified.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If false,&quot; cried Mr. Jordano,&mdash;they were now at
Mr. Bygood&#39;s door, and the ladies withdrew their arms,
enabling him to fling his cloak over his left shoulder
with a noble gesture&mdash;&quot;if false, it has no place in the
columns of the <i>Cyrus Centinel</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class="h2">CHAPTER VIII<br />
<span class="smcap">the trivial round</span></p>

<p class="indent">These things and many more happened in the
winter; in February, to be exact. A month
later, when I came to make my annual visit in
beloved Cyrus, things had &quot;simpered down,&quot; as Mr.
Mallow said. The excitement of Kitty&#39;s arrival, followed
by the nine days&#39; wonder of Miss Johanna
Ross&#39;s return, were&mdash;not forgotten, no indeed! but laid
away in spiritual camphor, as it were, to be aired and
shaken out from time to time.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My dear,&quot; said Madam Flynt (one&#39;s first visit was
always to Madam Flynt, one&#39;s second to the Misses
Bygood: it was a Propriety of Cyrus!)&mdash;&quot;it is not only
that we could not get along without Kitty: we have
forgotten that we ever did get along without her.
She drives too fast; I go in fear of my life when we
turn a corner; but except for that, it is an ideal arrangement.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The dear Doctor always drove fast!&quot; Miss Croly
looked up pensively from her knitting. &quot;I suppose
Kitty learned it naturally from him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I suppose she did; but the dear Doctor never broke
my neck, Cornelia Croly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Kitty has not broken it, Clarissa, has she?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page99" id="page99"></a>[pg&nbsp;99]</span>
&quot;Not yet, and I don&#39;t mean she shall. Where are
you going, Cornelia?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To get your milk-posset!&quot; Miss Croly was rolling
up her knitting methodically. &quot;It is four o&#39;clock.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t want milk-posset: get me some orange-juice!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The Doctor recommended milk-posset!&quot; Miss
Croly&#39;s tone was mild, but firm. &quot;I will try to make
it palatable, Clarissa.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I tell you I won&#39;t have it! Whose house is this,
I should like to know?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yours, assuredly, Clarissa. I can leave it at any
moment you desire, but while here I must do my duty
as I see it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What a pretty scarf, Miss Croly!&quot; I said hastily.
How natural to be a buffer again! &quot;Is it for a baby?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Madam Flynt uttered something between a snort
and a chuckle.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Baby, indeed! I don&#39;t wonder you ask, my dear.
Tell her what it&#39;s for, Cornelia Croly!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;For the deep-sea fishermen, my love!&quot; Miss Croly
glowed softly. &quot;Most people send them gray mufflers,
you know, but I feel as if a little variety, a touch
of color, in their dangerous lives, would be desirable.
The ocean! so grand, but so fraught with peril!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;In a storm, you understand,&quot; Madam Flynt actually
snorted this time; &quot;a pink, blue and yellow
muffler would be more comforting than a gray one.
Of course! Any one can see that!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are pleased to be facetious, my dear Clarissa;&quot;
Miss Croly paused, her hand on the door;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100"></a>[pg&nbsp;100]</span>
&quot;but I conceive that in case of disaster, the attention
of a&mdash;of a bark of rescue would be more readily attracted
by the waving of a bright object than of a dull
one!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She slipped out quickly and shut the door quietly
upon the last word. Madam Flynt looked after her
with an air of exasperation.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The most provoking woman&mdash;I have half a mind
to call her back! What were you saying, my dear?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">I was saying as quickly as I could how very well
Madam Flynt was looking. I hoped the rheumatism
was fairly routed this time. The dear lady&#39;s brow
cleared at once.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Much better! I am bound to say that it is much
better than I ever expected it to be. Cornelia Croly,
who has really more sense than you would give her
credit for&quot;&mdash;she cast another exasperated glance at
the door&mdash;&quot;says that I seem ten years younger, and I
certainly do move much more freely than I have for
years. It is partly the driving: Kitty is a delightful
companion, you know, and she keeps me out a good
part of the afternoon, instead of skimping the last
ten minutes of the hour, as Flanagan did&mdash;old wretch!
His carriage was uncomfortable, too, and as for his
horses! Every day he would ask regularly whether
I would have &#39;the plain hoss or the double-speeder:&#39;
the double-speeder went about four miles an hour; as
for the other&mdash;well, he&#39;s dead, and Flanagan, too, so
no matter. John Tucker&#39;s horses, and the cee springs,
and Kitty and all, makes driving a very different matter,
I can tell you. But besides that, my dear, I verily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>[pg&nbsp;101]</span>
believe&quot;&mdash;Madam Flynt nodded this time, till her
green cap ribbons quivered&mdash;&quot;I verily believe Johanna
has something to do with it!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Johanna?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Well, I had only arrived the day before, and Kitty
was out when I flew into Ross House on my way to
Madam Flynt&#39;s: going to Kitty&#39;s did not count as a
visit, of course!</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You don&#39;t mean you haven&#39;t heard? My dear!&quot;
Madam Flynt&#39;s handsome hands were trembling with
eagerness, her lips began to shape the words before
she could find voice to utter them. &quot;You don&#39;t mean
you haven&#39;t heard?&quot; she repeated. Madam Flynt was
no gossip, but she loved to talk, and going out so little,
she had fewer opportunities than the Gadderenes,
as Dr. Ross used to call some of his neighbors. One&#39;s
first visit was made to her, as I have said: but ten to
one Cissy Sharpe or her mother had waylaid one on
the way from the station, with &quot;Oh, howdy do! quite
a stranger! Have you heard&quot;&mdash;and before getting
free one had heard.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Johanna Ross&mdash;Kitty&#39;s aunt, the Doctor&#39;s only
sister; very likely you never heard of her, my dear,
just visiting as you do&quot;&mdash;(Oh, Madam Flynt! as
if I were not Cyrus born and bred, and exiled through
no fault of mine!)&mdash;&quot;but&mdash;well, anyhow, she has
come home after <i>twenty years</i> of absence; and what
is more she has <i>taken to her bed</i>, and there she is!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Madam Flynt drew herself up and nodded gravely:
the green satin cap ribbons following suit.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page102" id="page102"></a>[pg&nbsp;102]</span>
&quot;Is she seriously ill?&quot; I asked, wondering.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My dear! she <i>says</i> there is nothing whatever the
matter with her except fatigue. I can understand
that!&quot; she nodded again. &quot;Perfectly. One doesn&#39;t
always care to discuss chronic or deep-seated troubles.
Sometimes when people say &#39;rheumatism&#39; to me, I
want to throw the fire-irons at them. I don&#39;t mean
you, my dear; perfectly natural and right for you to
ask; I should have been hurt if you hadn&#39;t. Well!
there Johanna is, as I said. I go over to see her once
a week&mdash;walk over, with the step of youth, Cornelia
Croly says, and there I find her in her bed, looking as
permanent as the Pyramids.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At this moment Miss Croly came in softly with the
milk-posset. Madam Flynt took it with an absent-minded,
&quot;Thanks, Cornelia!&quot; drank it off, then paused
with a look of discomfiture.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I told you I wouldn&#39;t take it!&quot; she said sharply.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Your natural good sense&quot;&mdash;murmured Miss Croly
with a glance at the empty cup&mdash;&quot;the Doctor recommended&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hang the Doctor! and you, too!&quot; exclaimed
Madam Flynt. &quot;You&mdash;you&mdash;you&mdash;<i>go away</i>, Cornelia
Croly! go and&quot;&mdash;Miss Croly was already at the door,
aggressive meekness in every line of face and figure&mdash;&quot;and
bring me my smelling-salts, if you will have
the goodness!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The last words were spoken with austere dignity:
but, the door once closed, Madam Flynt&#39;s sense of
humor was too much for her. Her lips began to
twitch, her eyes to twinkle even under the bent brows
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id="page103"></a>[pg&nbsp;103]</span>
of anger. She struggled for a moment, then burst
into a hearty fit of laughter.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The old fox!&quot; she cried. &quot;She gets the better of
me every time! every time, Mary! She&#39;s chuckling
to herself now, but she&#39;ll come in as sober as&mdash;thank
you, Cornelia! I hope you haven&#39;t over-exerted yourself!&quot;
as Miss Croly, still aggressively meek, retired
to a corner with her rainbow scarf. Dear me! yes,
she always sat in that uncomfortable chair when they
had had a tiff.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What was I saying, my dear?&quot; Madam Flynt
rubbed her nose with her silver spectacle-case, and
threw a vexed glance toward the corner.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, yes, Johanna! like the Pyramids, my dear,
I assure you! I don&#39;t mean in looks&quot; (I had a moment&#39;s
vision of Cheops with a nightcap tilted over
his apex) &quot;she looks like a picture&mdash;but in permanence.
Sits up morning and evening to have her bed
made: and, as Cornelia Croly says, in some mysterious
way it makes me feel younger just to look at her.
Cornelia, stop being ridiculous, and come out of that
corner. I didn&#39;t really swear at you, though you are
enough to make one.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Seeing reconciliation imminent, I slipped away, to
find my Kitty in the stable. My Kitty! I was just as
foolish about her as any one else. I had not seen her
since all the happenings, but by and by we were quiet
and comfortable, and combing out Pilot&#39;s beautiful
mane, as if we had never been away, either of us.
Kitty confided to me that she was awaiting John
Tucker&#39;s return in trepidation, not to say terror. She
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page104" id="page104"></a>[pg&nbsp;104]</span>
had bought a new horse, bought it all by herself, without
John Tucker&#39;s seeing it. That is, not actually
bought it, but taken it on trial.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How could I? Mary, I don&#39;t know! We had
decided that we must have a third horse. The business
is growing so, my dear! Mr. Chanter&#39;s horse is
lame, and I have to take the dear man on his out-of-town
calls. <i>Such</i> fun! well, this morning&mdash;oh! oh!
Mary! here is John Tucker. Now I must confess to
him. Stay by me, won&#39;t you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Dan and John Tucker came into the stable, a sturdy,
handsome pair. I was warmly greeted (I, too, had
been Don Tutter&#39;s Dal when time was) and allowed
to lead Dan into his stall. I hurried to the harness
room in time to hear Kitty&#39;s confession, she standing
like a schoolgirl with her hands behind her, John
Tucker in that state of glowing pride in her that he
could hardly take in the situation.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;John Tucker, dear, I have bought a horse!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You have, Miss Kitty? You <i>have</i>? Well, to be
sure! the spirit of you! I&#39;ll bet he&#39;s a good one.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He&#39;s a miracle, John! A beautiful bright bay,
with a star on his forehead, and four white stockings;
you know I never could abide odd stockings.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, Miss! To be sure not. Where did you get
him, if I may make so bold, Miss Kitty?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t talk about making bold, John Tucker. It&#39;s
I who have been making bold. I am scared out of
my wits, you know I am, but he <i>is</i> such a beauty!
Let&#39;s sit down, John Tucker dear, and I&#39;ll tell you
all about it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page105" id="page105"></a>[pg&nbsp;105]</span>
Perched sidewise on the arm of a chair, her hands
clasped on her knee, her chin tilted up, Kitty was so
enchanting an object that I could not wonder at John
Tucker&#39;s fatuous expression. Probably if she had
told him of the purchase of a giraffe or an elephant,
he would have looked no less fatuous. As it was&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You see, John,&quot; Kitty began slowly, taking out a
hatpin and jabbing it into the arm of the chair to
punctuate her remarks, &quot;I took Mr. Chanter to see a
poor old Thing who is sick, and in trouble besides;
sad trouble, I&#39;m afraid. Her son hasn&#39;t been doing
well lately; but&mdash;well&mdash;he is a good son to her, only
he has been unfortunate. He deals in horses&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">John Tucker looked up. &quot;What was the name, did
you say, Miss?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I didn&#39;t say, John Tucker dear, but the name is
Boody; Mrs. L. M. Boody. Her son is L. M., too.
I don&#39;t know&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ellum Boody: Slippery Ellum!&quot; murmured John
Tucker. &quot;Scuse me, Miss Kitty. Luke his name is,
but he&#39;s known like I say. Scuse me, Miss Kitty!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I <i>hope</i> he isn&#39;t slippery, John Tucker, dear.
Let me tell you! I was sitting out in Mr. Chanter&#39;s
buggy, when he&mdash;Boody, I mean&mdash;drove into the yard
with this horse. His name is Hero, John; good name,
don&#39;t you think? I was taken with him at once; such
a beautiful color, and holds his head so well! The
man touched his hat, and was very civil; I said how
handsome the horse was, and he was <i>most</i> enthusiastic.
Said he had never had such a fine horse in
his stable, and he wouldn&#39;t part with him for a gold
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page106" id="page106"></a>[pg&nbsp;106]</span>
mine if things weren&#39;t just as they were. So I asked
was he thinking of selling him, because you know
we decided we <i>had</i> to have one, John; and he said yes,
if the right party could be found. &#39;For sell that hoss
to the wrong party is what I couldn&#39;t do, not if he
was the Angel Gable!&#39; he said. Then I asked about
him, you know; six years old, sound and kind, a lady&#39;s
horse every inch of him, Boody said, and wouldn&#39;t
I like to take a turn behind him while I waited. So
I did, and he is a <i>good</i> roadster, John; eight or ten
miles an hour, I should think; Boody says twelve, but
I&#39;m not sure&mdash;&mdash;&quot; I glanced at John Tucker and
saw that he was not sure. &quot;Good action! lifts his
feet a <i>little</i> high, but Boody says that is his spirit;
and as to his disposition, John, just <i>think</i> what he
did one day! Some women hired him, Boody says,
and put him in their own wagon, and <i>forgot to fasten
the breeching</i>. They drove him seven miles over that
rough road by Gambrel Hill, all ups and downs,
you know, and he <i>never did a thing</i>! What do you
think of that, John Tucker?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sounds as if he might be some hoss!&quot; said John
Tucker cautiously. &quot;You&#39;ve took him on trial, you
say, Miss Kitty?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, John, a week. I thought in that time&mdash;why,
here he is now, this very minute!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A man was driving into the yard in a light trotting
sulky. We all hastened out into the yard.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You <i>were</i> quick, Mr. Boody!&quot; cried Kitty. &quot;This
is Mr. Boody, John Tucker, and this is Hero: isn&#39;t
he a beauty?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page107" id="page107"></a>[pg&nbsp;107]</span>
&quot;Mornin&#39;, Slip!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mornin&#39;, Tucker!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Both men spoke gravely. Seeing that they knew
each other, Kitty exchanged a glance with me, and
we slipped back a pace. Followed remarks on the
weather. It was seasonable, take it by and large, but
dry. What we wanted was a nice warm rain. That
was right; dry May made poor hay, no two ways to
that. John Tucker, still grave, inquired for the health
of Mr. Boody&#39;s Ma; he trusted she was smart these
days. It appeared that she was slim, Mr. Boody was
obliged to John Tucker for askin&#39;. Her victuals
didn&#39;t nourish her: any one gettin&#39; on in years, they
had to be nourished, you understand. John Tucker
expected that was right, too. Upon this, both men
pondered; John Tucker scrutinizing a wart on his left
knuckle, Mr. Boody whistling through his teeth and
looking up at the clouds. Presently:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Got a new hoss, I see!&quot; said John Tucker.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yep!&quot; Mr. Boody&#39;s gaze came down with alacrity.
&quot;The lady thought she&#39;d like to try him. Best hoss
ever I had in my stable, bar none. Pequot out of
Lady Lansing: sound and kind anywhere; lady&#39;s
hoss every inch of him. Rising six, and not an out
about him. You get that hoss and you&#39;ll get&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Boody paused abruptly. John Tucker had lifted
one of the bay&#39;s hind feet, and was examining it carefully.
Presently he straightened himself and looked
at Boody.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I was to Rochester Fair last fall!&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You was?&quot; A curious change came over Mr.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page108" id="page108"></a>[pg&nbsp;108]</span>
Boody&#39;s countenance. It seemed to flatten itself in
a singular way, while his mouth widened into an uneasy
grin. &quot;Pooty good show, wasn&#39;t it?&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pooty fair! good truck, and middlin&#39; stock. The
most re-markable thing I see at that fair&quot;&mdash;John
Tucker spoke slowly, and there was a certain metallic
quality in his voice that made Kitty look at him
quickly&mdash;&quot;the most re-markable was a young hoss;
bright bay, as it might be this hoss: same color, same
markin&#39;s; he was a pictur&#39; to look at, he sure was.
Well, sir, I see that hoss take and kick the wagon he
was hitched to into pieces that the biggest of &#39;em
wouldn&#39;t sell to a match factory. I was surprised!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There was a silence. Then L. M. Boody spoke, a
hint of bluster in his voice.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wal!&quot; he said. &quot;A kicker is a poor hoss, sure
enough; but all kickers ain&#39;t bay, nor all bays ain&#39;t
kickers. I brung this hoss for the lady to try, like
she said for me to. Where shall I leave him? Is she
boss here, or are you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">His speech was insolent, his look craven. John
Tucker stepped forward, his sixty years resting very
lightly on him. His meditative drawl gave place to
quick, ringing speech.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Miss Ross is boss here,&quot; he said, &quot;and that hoss
shall go anywhere she tells me to put him. Before
she gives her orders, she&#39;s going to hear what I have
to say&mdash;if you have the time to spare, Miss&mdash;Miss
Ross!&quot; He turned to Kitty with a bow and gesture
that would not have shamed a court. Kitty&#39;s cheeks
were flushing and her eyes widening and darkening.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page109" id="page109"></a>[pg&nbsp;109]</span>
One knew precisely what the Chanters meant by saying
that her eyes were sometimes a mile round.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you please, John!&quot; she said quietly.</p>

<p class="indent">Then John Tucker, standing very straight, thus delivered
himself.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Miss Kitty, I&#39;m a common man, and I may be mistook;
but if I know anything&mdash;anything <i>at all</i>, let
alone hosses&mdash;this young hoss is that identical young
hoss that I see kick that shay to slivers over to
Rochester. How do I know? Well, his color is the
same, his markin&#39;s is the same, his shape and his action
is the same. But that ain&#39;t all! That young hoss
over to Rochester, he was a pictur&#39; fer looks, same as
this one; but yet when I looked in his countenance, I
felt someways or another as if I couldn&#39;t say nothin&#39;
favorable about him. Don&#39;t know how &#39;tis, but that
feelin&#39; &#39;ll come over me, &#39;bout a hoss or &#39;bout a bein&#39;,
&#39;cordin&#39; to; and when it comes, <i>I know it&#39;s right</i>. Now
that same feelin&#39; has come over me about this young
hoss. And why?&quot; John Tucker&#39;s voice rose. &quot;Because
he is the same hoss! But that ain&#39;t all!&quot; as Mr.
Boody was about to speak. &quot;You might say one bust
don&#39;t set a hoss down a kicker. That is so, but I say
this ain&#39;t a case of one bust; I say this hoss has been
kickin&#39; within twenty-four hours.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Like to see you prove it!&quot; said Boody. &quot;Easy
there, Hero! He knows you&#39;re slanderin&#39; him. You
can&#39;t fool this hoss. You&#39;ll get into trouble, John
Tucker. I&#39;ll have the law of you if&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The horse had laid back his ears, and was settling
back in a curious way.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page110" id="page110"></a>[pg&nbsp;110]</span>
&quot;Look out!&quot; said John Tucker sharply.</p>

<p class="indent">Boody, with a muttered curse and a savage look,
laid his whip heavily over the horse&#39;s withers. The
animal hesitated a moment, then sprang forward;
another moment, and they had vanished round the
corner in a cloud of dust.</p>

<p class="indent">John Tucker turned to Kitty with an apologetic air.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;m sorry, Miss Kitty!&quot; he said. &quot;I&#39;m real sorry.
I would of if I could&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, John Tucker, don&#39;t!&quot; Kitty was scarlet, her
eyes flashing, her hands clenched. &quot;The <i>horrid</i> man!
Oh, I am so grateful to you, John! But how <i>did</i> you
know?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, Miss Kitty, you see, &#39;twas easy enough, look
at it one way. I&#39;d seed the hoss before, seed him at
his tricks, too. Yes&#39;m: I&#39;d seed him before, and&mdash;&quot; a
joke began to twinkle in John Tucker&#39;s eyes, and
spread all over him till he became incandescent; you
could have lighted a match at him; &quot;and now I&#39;ve seed
him behind! haw! haw! You see me lift up his off hind
foot? Well, why did I do that? Because when he
shifted his footin&#39; I see a spark of yeller. Come to
look, and lo ye, his hoof was kind o&#39; crushed in above
the shoe, where he&#39;d struck iron, and there was a
flake of yellow paint on it big as my thumb nail.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And he knew that!&quot; Kitty was pale now, not with
fear but with anger. &quot;The scoundrel!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well!&quot; John Tucker pulled out his jack-knife and
made a thoughtful incision in the door-jamb. &quot;I dono
as I&#39;d just say that; I dono as he&#39;s a scoundrel; he&#39;s
a trader! I&#39;ve heard it said,&mdash;I dono as it&#39;s so, and I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page111" id="page111"></a>[pg&nbsp;111]</span>
dono <i>as</i> it is&mdash;but I&#39;ve heard it said that there ain&#39;t
no one, not even a minister of the Gospel, a holy man,
but what he&#39;ll stretch the truth just a little grain in a
hoss trade.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">John Tucker closed his jack-knife with a snap.
&quot;Forget it, Miss Kitty!&quot; he said, and his tone expressed
finality. &quot;You won&#39;t have no more trouble
with Slippery Ellum. He thought he&#39;d try it on,
that&#39;s all, to keep his hand in, like; tradin&#39; is like
drink to him. Hark! there&#39;s that hen again!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What hen, John?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">John Tucker chuckled and made a gesture of caution.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now I&#39;ll show ye something curious, gals. I would
say young ladies. You hear that hen cackle? Well,
it&#39;s that little Brown Leghorn. She&#39;s made her nest
in Dan&#39;s manger, and she won&#39;t lay nowhere else, not
if the President was to ask her. Easy now! Don&#39;t
let Dan see you!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Cautiously, we followed him into the stable, flattening
ourselves against the wall so that we could not
be seen from the loose boxes; very cautiously we
peeped round the window opening. Dan, wisest of
horses since old Victory died, was standing in the
middle of the box, every fibre of him alert, his eyes
fixed on a corner of the manger. In this corner sat a
Brown Leghorn hen, proclaiming to the world that
she had laid an egg. Having made this perfectly clear,
she rose slowly from her nest, clucked, cocked an approving
eye at the egg, clapped her wings, said,
&quot;Scraw!&quot; several times, finally hopped down to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page112" id="page112"></a>[pg&nbsp;112]</span>
barn floor and departed, presumably in search of corn.
In a flash, Dan&#39;s velvet nose was in the nest. Carefully
he lipped the egg, daintily he took it in his teeth;
a crack, a gulp; luncheon was over, and Dan looked
up as we advanced, with eyes of innocent welcome.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, Dan!&quot; cried Kitty. &quot;You old fox! Do
you mean that he does this regularly, John?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Reg&#39;lar every day since she begun to lay. I&#39;d
ought to stop him, but honest, he&#39;s so cute, and so
quick, I&#39;d need to spend the mornin&#39; watchin&#39;!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sugar, please!&quot; said Dan. &quot;I am very hungry!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You really ought to be ashamed, Dan.&quot; Kitty
was searching in her pocket. &quot;You are extremely
greedy, beloved. You shall have only one lump, and
Pilot shall have two, because he has had no egg. Oh,
me! there is the supper bell. We must run, Mary!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Sarepta, at the kitchen door, bell in hand, addressed
us with severity.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Supper&#39;s ready, girls. Come in just as you are,
Kitty, or the waffles will be leathery. Hasten, now!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mary,&quot; said Kitty, as we scurried across the yard,
&quot;do you suppose I shall ever be more than ten years
old, in blessed Cyrus?&quot;</p>

<p class="h2">CHAPTER IX<br />
<span class="smcap">the skeleton in cyrus&#39; cupboard</span></p>

<p class="indent">Perhaps no one was enjoying Kitty and her
horses more at this time than the Reverend Timothy
Chanter. When he came to Cyrus, to replace
the Reverend Holdfast Baxter, deceased after a
pastorate of forty-seven years, he took over the parsonage
as it stood, and with it Gudgeon the sexton,
Felicity the cat and Podasokus the horse. The age of
Podasokus might be anywhere from twenty to forty
years. The children, who had known him all their
lives, supposed him to be a hundred. He was a singular,
moth-eaten old creature, seeming to slope all
ways at once; I don&#39;t know how else to describe him.
He could trot rather fast when he wished, but this
was seldom; he preferred to jog or single-foot at a
rate of three miles an hour. This had suited Mr. Baxter
well enough, for he composed his sermons while
driving; as for his parish calls, if he could not
compass them, he was all the better pleased. But
Mr. Chanter, deep in his heart, had an inborn love of
good horses and fast driving. It was part of his
simple creed to deny himself anything he specially
liked; it was an affair between himself and his Maker&mdash;or
so he thought. The neck of the fowl was always
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>[pg&nbsp;114]</span>
his portion, till Mrs. Chanter took the carving
into her own hands; he found the fireside too hot in
winter, the shady corner too cool in summer. Much
of his wife&#39;s time was devoted to circumventing &quot;Pelican
Pa,&quot; as he was disrespectfully called in the bosom
of the family. Acting on this principle, Mr. Chanter
had never thought of exchanging Podasokus for a
better animal. He was there. If one could &quot;live well
in a palace,&quot; one could also drive a slow horse. So,
when he was in a hurry, he walked, or borrowed the
boys&#39; bicycle. When he had plenty of time, he drove
Podasokus.</p>

<p class="indent">When Podasokus felt that he must have a nap in
the middle of the high road, Mr. Chanter hauled the
wagon to the hedge, and read the works of the late
R. J. Ingersoll, which he particularly disliked, till
the steed woke up again and jogged along.</p>

<p class="indent">These things being so, Mr. Chanter found it hard
to grieve deeply when &quot;Pod&quot; went lame, and he must
call upon Kitty Ross for his longer expeditions. The
parish was a straggling one; Cyrus itself is compact
as a pie, but South, East and West Cyrus stretch far
over hill and dale. What more delightful than to drive
to South Cyrus behind Dan or Pilot, with Kitty holding
the reins? Kitty was the perfect companion, Mr.
Chanter said. She talked just enough and not too
much; and she always seemed to know when one was
inclined to meditate or&mdash;a&mdash;&quot;or sleep!&quot; assented Mrs.
Chanter, who had &quot;put Kitty wise&quot; on certain points.
&quot;Exactly!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">On a pleasant April morning the two were thus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page115" id="page115"></a>[pg&nbsp;115]</span>
driving along the South Cyrus road. Pilot was in the
shafts, and in high spirits. The day before had been
rainy, and he had not been out; now he sped along the
sun-dappled road as if every stride were a pleasure;
now and then breaking into a canter of rejoicing, to be
checked by Kitty with affectionate firmness. When
they had climbed and dipped the intervening hills and
the plain stretched before them like a floor, Mr. Chanter
leaned back in his seat and rubbed his hands.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This is delightful!&quot; he said. &quot;This is de-lightful,
Kitty! ha! the poetry of motion.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;&#39;And thought the air must rush as fresh</span><br />
<span class="i4">To swallows on the wing!&#39;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">A fine horse (and Pilot is a remarkably fine horse!) is
after mankind, one of the noblest works of God.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Isn&#39;t he?&quot; said Kitty. &quot;And not always such a
long way after, do you think, Mr. Chanter? Compare
Pilot, or Dan either, with&mdash;with some people!
that horrid Boody man! Neither Pilot nor Dan would
<i>think</i> of cheating in a horse trade!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Surely not! surely not!&quot; Mr. Chanter acquiesced.
&quot;They would scorn such an action.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;To be sure, Dan does steal eggs!&quot; Kitty continued
meditatively. &quot;But then&mdash;that seems a little different,
don&#39;t you think? A hen is <i>such</i> a goose!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Surely not! surely not!&quot; said the Reverend Timothy
again in sonorous accent.</p>

<p class="indent">Kitty glanced at him: he was making a series of
courteous bows to Pilot&#39;s glossy hindquarters; was in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page116" id="page116"></a>[pg&nbsp;116]</span>
fact as nearly asleep as any one could be whose eyes
were only half shut.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dear soul!&quot; murmured Kitty to herself. &quot;He was
up half the night with that sick man, Mrs. Chanter
said. He might as well take a good nap. Easy now,
Pilot! easy, dear boy!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pilot, who had been dancing a bit in the joy of his
heart, settled into a smooth trot, and conveyed to Kitty
by a toss of his beautiful head that he could keep this
up all day, though it was a trifle dull. &quot;Never mind,
darling!&quot; said Kitty. &quot;You shall rush all the way
home if you like.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She fell into a muse, as the miles sped smoothly by.
It was spring; really and truly, or almost really and
truly, almost spring.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;Really spring, or nearly spring,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And, oh, I love you dearly, spring!&quot;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">she hummed under her breath. Kitty loved to think
in rhyme. Sometimes for days together she and
Tommy would hardly speak in prose. Tommy was
far cleverer, of course: (he was not!) did he talk
rhyme now, Kitty wondered, and if so, to whom?
Something pricked her; she put the thought resolutely
away.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;&#39;Tis a month before the month of May,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And the spring comes slowly up this way.&quot;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">What was the strange magic of those two lines?
They simply <i>were</i> the New England spring, which
Coleridge never saw. Ah! pussy willows! she must
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id="page117"></a>[pg&nbsp;117]</span>
get some&mdash;she half checked the horse, but chirruped
to him again with a little sigh. Nobody to take pussy
willows to, now. How Mother loved them! They
were just like that gray velvet gown of hers. Little
Mother! Aunt Johanna wouldn&#39;t care for pussy willows;
as for Sarepta&mdash;&mdash;! But how good they both
were; what really interesting persons! and so bracing
to live with! Kitty chuckled, recalling the after breakfast
hour this morning.</p>

<p class="indent">She was making her customary call on Aunt
Johanna, and that lady, erect amid her pillows, resplendent
in sapphire blue and Mechlin (she had a
different jacket for every morning; the bedridden, she
maintained, must make variety for themselves!) was
holding forth on the subject of classes. &quot;Keep people
<i>in their place</i>!&quot; said the lady. &quot;It is my invariable
rule. If a salesman is uppish with me, he takes his
uppishness elsewhere within twenty-four hours. Whenever
any one forgets his place, put him back in it
<i>without delay</i>. Delay makes for uncertainty, and uncertainty
is fatal in business and everywhere else. An
instance, my dear! The day before I left New York,
I took a friend, a nice young girl, who didn&#39;t have
many friends, to the Ritz Carlton for lunch. They
have good coffee there; not like Sarepta&#39;s, but good.
Well, after the ice-cream I ordered peaches; the waiter
brought me two. <i>Two peaches!</i> I looked at him. &#39;I
ordered peaches!&#39; I said. &#39;I did not specify the number.&#39;
He mumbled something, and I told him to speak
up. &#39;Peaches is very expensive, Mum!&#39; said the creature.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page118" id="page118"></a>[pg&nbsp;118]</span>
Kitty burst into a ripple of laughter. &quot;I wish I
had been there, Aunt Johanna. What did you say?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Say? I said, &#39;Trot along, Nancy! Do I look as if
I couldn&#39;t pay for &#39;em?&#39; He trotted.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Kitty&#39;s laughter rippled again as she recalled her
aunt&#39;s gesture.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Speaking of trotting, Pilot dear,&quot; she said, &quot;we
might as well&mdash;quiet, boy! quiet!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pilot had shied, a thing almost unheard of. They
were passing a tall dark hedge; something rustled in
it, and startled the horse. As Kitty soothed him, a
figure half emerged from a gap in the hedge; she was
aware of a thin, dark, haggard face, of two burning
eyes, which fixed her for an instant with a piercing
gaze; then the figure slunk back again and the branches
closed over it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Surely not! surely not!&quot; said the Reverend Timothy
Chanter, in a tone of profound conviction. &quot;You
were speaking of the good horse, my dear; has anything
annoyed him? I think I lost myself a moment.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He was startled, and I don&#39;t wonder; I was startled
too. A man came out of the hedge: such a strange-looking
man, Mr. Chanter.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hedge? Man?&quot; Mr. Chanter glanced around him
and his face changed. &quot;What kind of man, Kitty?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A wild, ragged man. He looked sick, and&mdash;I had
just a glimpse, but he looked&mdash;all wrong, somehow.
It&#39;s the old Gaylord place, you know. I never saw
any living creature about it before,&mdash;but once! Have
you ever seen any one there, Mr. Chanter?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page119" id="page119"></a>[pg&nbsp;119]</span>
Mr. Chanter cleared his throat with some elaboration.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I believe it has not been inhabited for some years,&quot;
he replied. There was a shade on his candid countenance.
He was not in the habit of evading the direct
answer.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is a fine place, spite of its neglected condition.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Kitty glanced back at the dark hedge, with the
dark chimneys rising above it, and shivered a little.
&quot;I have always been afraid of the place, somehow!&quot;
she said. &quot;I had a fright there once, when I was a
child.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Had you so, my love? No one should ever frighten
a child. Very remiss: very wrong, if intentional.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, no, no one meant to frighten me. It was
just an accident. We used to go there for nuts, Tom
Lee and I. There was a huge chestnut tree&mdash;I suppose
it is still there&mdash;by the side door of the house. It
bore the biggest chestnuts I ever saw, and Tom and I
went there regularly every October. There was something
terrifying about the great dark shuttered house;
(to me, that is: Tom was never afraid of anything;)
and that always made it an exciting expedition. You
know there is a round hole in every shutter, near the
top? We used to make believe we saw eyes looking
at us out of those holes; and then&mdash;one day&mdash;&quot; Kitty
shivered again: &quot;well, one day, there <i>were</i> eyes!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My child! my child! a&mdash;a&mdash;lively imagination, no
doubt! The young&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, Mr. Chanter, the eyes were there: we saw
them wink. And then&mdash;we used to call that little side
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page120" id="page120"></a>[pg&nbsp;120]</span>
door the postern, and imagine all kinds of people coming
out of it, knights and giants and princesses&mdash;well;
all of a sudden the door did open, and a man came
out&mdash;why!&quot; Kitty stopped short and turned a pale
face on her companion. &quot;Why, Mr. Chanter, I believe&mdash;it
was&mdash;the&mdash;same man!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The same man, my dear?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The man I saw just now! He wasn&#39;t so thin or so
haggard then: he wasn&#39;t ragged; but&mdash;the wild look,
the burning eyes&mdash;oh, Mr. Chanter, it all comes back
to me. It was the same man!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Chanter was silent for some time: then&mdash;&quot;And
whom did you suppose the man to be, my love?
Did he speak to you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No! I think he might have, but we ran away. We
were trespassing, of course, and I was frightened out
of my wits. We supposed&quot;&mdash;her voice dropped: &quot;we
told Father, and he said it was probably the owner of
the house, and bade us say nothing about it to any
one.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Chanter&#39;s face cleared a little.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very sound advice!&quot; he said. &quot;Excellent advice,
my dear. Do you know, Kitty, my child, I believe
you cannot do better than to follow it in this case
also.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Villages as well as houses have their skeleton cupboards.
The Gaylord place was Cyrus&#39; cupboard.
Built in the middle of the eighteenth century, it had
been inhabited by one generation after another of
Gaylords; all people of the same stripe as their neighbors,
gentle, cultivated, a little passive, a little inclined
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page121" id="page121"></a>[pg&nbsp;121]</span>
to smile and let the world go by. They farmed their
wide acres; they loved their books, they caught trout
at one season and shot woodcock at another, they
spent certain weeks or months in the City. So things
went for a hundred years and more. Then one Gaylord,
more enterprising than his forebears, made
money: copper, I think it was, in the early Calumet
days. The money did him no special harm. He refurnished
the house rather more splendidly than Cyrus
thought in quite good taste, but his wife came from the
City, and what could one expect? He bought a good
many books, and some pictures, and enjoyed himself
immensely: then he died, a few weeks after his City
wife, and their son inherited.</p>

<p class="indent">Kitty and I were babies when Russell Gaylord was
running his race to perdition. In our childhood we
used to hear a good deal about him; never from our
parents, nor from Sarepta Darwin, but I am afraid
we did listen to Cissy Sharpe, who knew all about it,
or thought she did. He threw the money right and
left. He drove four-in-hand through Cyrus streets
with his college mates, to the scandal of the community;
he held revels in the old house, with a hundred
wax candles in each room, and flowers and music such
as had never been dreamed of in the quiet village.
People shook their heads, but indulgently: they were
proud of the handsome, open-hearted boy. He had
such pleasant ways! He loved to put a dime in the
contribution box at church, and then slyly, after service,
to pile it high with anonymous gold pieces. He
loved to send preposterous Christmas boxes to everybody
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page122" id="page122"></a>[pg&nbsp;122]</span>
he knew, and to pile up loads of wood by night
in lean woodsheds. People said he would learn in
time; his heart was in the right place. He was the
most brilliant scholar in his class, could stand at the
head if he would only study; when he had sown his
wild oats, he would settle down in Cyrus and be a
credit to all. Even when he ran over their dogs and
in a tipsy frolic smashed the post office windows, they
forgave him and loved him. He was a Gaylord, and
could not really do anything much out of the way.</p>

<p class="indent">Then came the crash. A riotous houseparty of
men from the City (poor City! it had to bear the
sins of many a village like Cyrus!); a quarrel over the
gaming table; an insult; a blow, a knife-thrust; a
young man slain in his folly, and blood on Russell
Gaylord&#39;s white hands.</p>

<p class="indent">They had all been drinking; the verdict brought in
was manslaughter, the sentence ten years&#39; imprisonment.
No sooner was the trial over than the creditors
came flocking like vultures. Judge Peters&mdash;young
Lawyer Peters, he was then,&mdash;who had charge
of the estate, paid and paid and paid; debts of honor,
so called, contracted in dishonor; bills for horses, for
carriages, for rich wines and costly jewelry: he set
his teeth and paid them all. The last bill took practically
the last dollar; the house was closed, and for
many a day Russell Gaylord&#39;s name was spoken no
more in Cyrus.</p>

<p class="indent">It must have been soon after his release from prison
that Kitty and Tom saw him. It began to be whispered
about, not among the gossips, but quietly, among
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page123" id="page123"></a>[pg&nbsp;123]</span>
those who had been friends of the family, that Russell
had been back; that Marshall Mallow had seen him
and spoken with him; that he was a wreck of his former
self, his one idea to forget his troubles in drink.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Sharpe never heard this, though she knew
something was going on. She knew that one night
Judge Peters was out till midnight, <i>no one knew
where</i>; she saw him come home and she <i>thought</i> he
didn&#39;t put his latch key in any too easy: and that she
had met Marsh Mallow and Very Jordano at <i>ten
o&#39;clock</i>, when she was hastening home to her bed, having
taken some gruel to those Jessups who were never
thankful for anything, and she met those two men
walking in the street, with their faces turned <i>away
from their homes</i>, they best knew why. This was all
she knew: she made the most of it, and succeeded
in impressing Mrs. Scatter and Mrs. Wibird with a
sense of impending calamity; but when the latter
went to her brother with a face of woe, and &quot;Oh,
Marshall! what <i>is</i> going on in Cyrus Village? Is
Satan abroad in our midst, think? I do feel a trembling
like in my inside!&quot; she was met with a calm,
&quot;Take a dose of rhubarb, Marshy! that&#39;ll drive Satan
out if he <i>has</i> got into your cistern!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Mallow meant &quot;system&quot; presumably: anyhow
he was pleased with his remark, and repeated it to
Mrs. Wibird&#39;s indignant back as she left the room.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The idea!&quot; he said to the fire-irons. &quot;Nine o&#39;clock
bell&#39;s a good thing, and I allus stand for it; but a man
might stay up till half past or so once in a while, you&#39;d
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page124" id="page124"></a>[pg&nbsp;124]</span>
think, &#39;thout every woman in the place gettin&#39; all
frustrated up!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">All this was ten years ago, be it remembered. The
whispers had died away; silence had spread and deepened
about the deserted house; all was as it had
been.</p>

<p class="indent">Kitty took Mr. Chanter&#39;s hint, and said no more
about the stranger who had startled her and Pilot.
Late that afternoon we two went for a walk, as we
were apt to do when she was at liberty, and I turned
naturally into what we always called Sunset Road,
because the sun seemed to go down at the end of it.
Kitty hesitated a moment at the corner, as if she
would suggest another direction; then turned with a
little shrug of self-rebuke and walked beside me. She
was rather silent; we usually babbled like twin brooks
towards the close of the day. When we passed the
Gaylord house, I looked up and to my amazement
saw a thin blue thread stealing up from one of the
chimneys.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Kitty!&quot; I said. &quot;Look! do you see the smoke?
Some one is in the Gaylord house!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Kitty told no one but me and Judge Peters; I am
very sure Mr. Chanter told no one else: but little by
little the knowledge sifted through Cyrus that Russell
Gaylord had come back once more. That he was living
in a corner of his great house, with not even a
dog to bear him company. That there was no use in
any one&#39;s trying to see him, as he would not open the
door, even to the Messrs. Jebus, his old schoolmates,
who had wished to show that they were prepared to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page125" id="page125"></a>[pg&nbsp;125]</span>
let bygones be bygones and welcome the prodigal back
to their kindly shop. Lastly, that he was a wreck, and
no one knew how he lived or where he got bread to
put in his mouth.</p>

<p class="indent">This last statement was false; some one did know.
Mr. Mallow sat up long after curfew these spring
nights; long after his staid &quot;help&quot; were snugly tucked
in their beds. Usually his bedroom light went out at
ten punctually; now it might be midnight when, nodding
by the kitchen fire, he would hear, or think he
heard, a shuffling step on the walk outside the back
door. Then he would open the door and stand in
the cold, holding it wide open so that the red fire-light
would shine out on the darkness.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Russ,&quot; he would whisper, &quot;that you? Come in,
won&#39;t you? Step in, and set with me a spell! what
say? I&#39;m rill lon&#39;some!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Usually no answer came; then he would say, &quot;Basket&#39;s
behind the door, Russ! Call again when &#39;tis
empty! Good-night, old chap!&quot; and shut the door with
a sigh, and so to bed. Usually, I say: but if now and
then a bent, shivering figure crept in and sat for half
an hour by the fire, warming its hands and listening
dumbly to the friendly pleadings, the kindly offers,
why, no one but Marshall Mallow ever knew it.</p>

<p class="h2">CHAPTER X<br />
<span class="smcap">the party</span></p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Going?&quot; said Miss Johanna Ross: &quot;of course
I&#39;m not going, Gerie; bed-ridden folks don&#39;t
go to parties&mdash;except in novels. I might be
carried in like that woman in &#39;Barchester Towers,&#39; in
a white velvet gown on a red silk sofa&mdash;or was it a
red shawl thrown over the sofa? Well, I have no
white velvet gown, but I think I could get up a fancy
rig. Imagine Madam Flynt&#39;s face! Do you advise it,
Gerie?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Egeria looked troubled: she never knew how
far to take Johanna seriously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You always look charming, dear Johanna,&quot; she
said. &quot;I hardly think&mdash;of course you know far more
than I about social functions: it is so long since we
had a large party in Cyrus&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Cheer up! I&#39;ll stay at home to please you!&quot; Miss
Johanna settled herself comfortably among her pillows.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now let me look at you!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In some trepidation, Miss Egeria removed her shawl
(that, at least, was all right; a camel&#39;s hair shawl was
always in good taste!) and felt the keen dark eyes take
in and appraise every item of her apparel; the dove-colored
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page127" id="page127"></a>[pg&nbsp;127]</span>
<i>moiré</i> of antiquated cut, the mosaic jewelry,
the &quot;bertha&quot; of splendid Honiton.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is so long since we had a party in Cyrus!&quot; Miss
Egeria repeated; her voice faltered a little; Johanna&#39;s
eyes were really&mdash;she felt quite&mdash;&quot;quite undressed,
my love!&quot; as she told Kitty afterward, &quot;as if I were
in my&mdash;my underwear!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Anne Peace took it in a little,&quot; she said, &quot;but she
thought it best not to alter the style: the lines were
good, she thought&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If Anne Peace had altered it I&#39;d have whipped her.
You are perfect, Gerie: a perfect &#39;Keepsake&#39;! I
wouldn&#39;t change you for any model on Fifth Avenue.
Where&#39;s Almeria? I don&#39;t believe she&#39;s a patch on
you!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, my dear! Almeria has the Velvet: you remember
the Velvet, surely! You always thought it elegant:
Aunt Vanderscholt, for whom it was made, employed
the best dressmaker in New York, I have always
understood. Sister is downstairs in the parlor
with Father: so kind of you and Kitty to help us out
in this way. Kitty is in <i>such</i> demand this evening!
Would you like to see Sister, Johanna? She charged
me to say&mdash;she felt that you would probably feel able
to see only one person at a time&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Gammon!&quot; Miss Johanna&#39;s eyes twinkled. &quot;Trot
her up, Gerie, and your father, too! Don&#39;t look like
that! I am perfectly proper: it won&#39;t hurt him to see
a bed at his time of life.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My dear Johanna!&quot; Miss Egeria gasped. &quot;Not for
worlds would Father intrude&mdash;a lady&#39;s chamber&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page128" id="page128"></a>[pg&nbsp;128]</span>
&quot;Mr. Bygood!&quot; Miss Johanna raised a clear, high-pitched
voice. &quot;Come up, won&#39;t you, and bring Almy?
I want to see you!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Egeria faded away with a little moan of protest;
a moment later entered Miss Almeria, superb
in black velvet, with a magnificent lace scarf on her admirable
shoulders.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah!&quot; said Miss Johanna under her breath. &quot;I
knew there was more Honiton. That&#39;s the flounce!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good evening, Almy!&quot; she said aloud. &quot;Where&#39;s
your father? Oh, how do you do, Mr. Bygood? I
<i>am</i> glad to see you! shake hands! Are you shocked?
Gerie was too shocked to stay in the room. How do
you like my jacket? You look perfectly lovely! I&#39;d
marry you to-morrow if you&#39;d ask me. Now I&#39;ve
shocked Almeria!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">If Miss Almeria was shocked, she knew better than
to give Johanna the satisfaction of knowing it. She
drew up a chair for her father and settled herself in
another, smoothing her velvet skirt composedly. Mr.
Bygood was in a flutter. To be going to a party was
exciting enough: to be called suddenly to wait upon an
invalid lady of distinction was even more thrilling.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My dear Miss Ross&mdash;&mdash;&quot; he began, with a tremulous
bow.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you call me &#39;Miss&#39;, I&#39;ll throw the pillow at you
and spoil your lovely necktie!&quot; said the lady.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh! oh!&mdash;te-hee! te-hee!&quot; tittered Mr. Bygood.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I used to be Jo,&quot; Miss Ross went on; and her sharp
eyes softened. &quot;Little naughty Jo, coming to play
with little proper Almy and little saintly Gerie, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page129" id="page129"></a>[pg&nbsp;129]</span>
getting them both into hot water. Have you any
peppermints in your pocket, Mr. Bygood? How
many generations of children have you supplied with
peppermints, my dear soul?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, Johanna!&quot; Mr. Bygood twinkled; &quot;several, I
suppose; several! Yours was the first, though, my
dear. You were a very good child, a very good child.
All my little friends have been good children. You&mdash;you&mdash;you
look extremely well, Johanna, for a&mdash;a
sufferer! I trust&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I <i>am</i> extremely well!&quot; said Miss Johanna calmly.
&quot;Bedridden, but well. Gerie wanted me to be carried
to the party in my bed&mdash;&quot; an agonized cough from
the hall announced that Miss Egeria was within hearing;
&quot;at least we spoke of it. Cheer up, Gerie! Nobody
would lay it to your door. &#39;Johanna! always peculiar!&#39;&quot;
(She shot a wicked glance at Miss Almeria,
who maintained her dignity, but could not suppress
her blush.) &quot;Can&#39;t you hear them say it? But I&#39;ve
decided not to go. I really think I am having the
cream of the party here. This was my idea, Almy;
you must allow I am clever, as well as peculiar. There&#39;s
some one else coming in.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It <i>was</i> a clever idea; Madam Flynt was giving a
party for Kitty and me; it was so kind of her to tuck
me in! Of course everybody was going, and as it was
a snowy evening in early April, Kitty and John Tucker
were engaged ten deep, to transport the guests. It
was necessary to begin early, and at Miss Johanna&#39;s
suggestion, Kitty had asked a few special friends to
be ready half an hour before the time set in the invitations.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page130" id="page130"></a>[pg&nbsp;130]</span>
These favored ones were brought to Ross
House, and deposited with instructions to walk right
in (Sarepta was at Madam Flynt&#39;s, of course, helping
Sarah and Abby Ann) and make Aunt Johanna a
call, and then make themselves comfy in the parlor
till called for.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Bygood was the only gentleman who went upstairs,
but the Chanters and several other parties of
ladies rustled up to the Red Indian room and were
passed in review by the invalid Arbitress. Last of
all came Kitty herself; first rosy and breathless, in
fur coat and cap, to summon Miss Johanna&#39;s last
caller; then, half an hour later, still rosy, but calm
and demure, to show herself to her aunt. I was with
her, in what male writers call &quot;something white and
filmy&quot;; I called it chiffon; Miss Johanna had forbidden
filminess for Kitty.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;When you&#39;ve got lines, show &#39;em!&quot; was her dictum.
How different from Miss Egeria, who was always
troubled if one sat down without shaking out
one&#39;s skirts thoroughly. &quot;My dear!&quot; she would whisper.
&quot;You show your shape!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Kitty had rummaged the ancestral trunks in the attic
and had found a thick, heavy pale green satin,
over which Miss Johanna had waved the scissors
of a necromancer, Miss Anne Peace, as her attendant
sprite (dear, meek little brown sprite! she was at
Madam Flynt&#39;s, too, &quot;taking off&quot; for the ladies upstairs),
translating her magic into terms of needle
and thread. The soft gleaming fabric clung round as
lovely a figure, I thought, as ever entered a ballroom.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page131" id="page131"></a>[pg&nbsp;131]</span>
There was just enough lace at the neck, not an inch
too much: wonderful Rose Point. The Bygoods were
not the only people who had lace, Miss Johanna said
with a friendly sniff: and there was the Beryl Necklace,
for which, the same lady pointed out, the satin
had probably been woven and dyed. Certainly they
were an astonishing match, and anything more beautiful
than the combination of necklace and gown and
Kitty cannot possibly be imagined. This is not just
my enthusiasm&mdash;everybody said the same thing&mdash;except
Miss Johanna; but her nod, and &quot;H&#39;m! you&#39;ll
do!&quot; was fully as emphatic.</p>

<p class="indent">So we went to the Party; our Party, given for us!
two proud and happy girls.</p>

<p class="indent">Madam Flynt&#39;s spacious double parlors looked more
ample than usual from the removal of most of the
furniture. The tables were gone, the big sofa, all the
armchairs except Madam Flynt&#39;s own; the Sheraton
chairs shrugging their shoulders against the wall took
up little room. The Turkey carpet was up, the polished
floor gleamed in the light of numberless wax
candles. Madam Flynt sat at the upper end of the
long room, stately and handsome in lilac brocade with
cascades of creamy Venetian Point. (I seem to be
saying a great deal about lace: I can&#39;t help it: it is
one of the pleasantest things I know!) Kitty and I
stood by her, one on either side; Miss Croly, her purple
alpaca exchanged for a silk of the same hue, hovered
in the background, beaming welcome on the
guests, but casting an occasional anxious glance at
her friend and patroness. On her arm she carried
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page132" id="page132"></a>[pg&nbsp;132]</span>
a white Canton crape shawl, heavily embroidered, with
long fringe. Occasionally she would bend over Madam
Flynt and murmur something, with a gesture toward
the shawl, but the hostess seemed unaware of her
existence.</p>

<p class="indent">The Bygoods were the first arrivals. &quot;Father&quot; must
have a chance to see the rooms, and to find a comfortable
seat, before the crowd came. Next came the
Messrs. Jebus, very nervous, very neat in their claret-colored
frock coats. Why did they wear claret-colored
frock coats? Everybody in Cyrus knows! Twenty-five
years ago Russell Gaylord had had one made
for a frolic, or a wager, I forget which; and after
wearing it once, had given to Mr. Jason. Even then,
the two cousins always dressed alike: Russell Gaylord
was the glass of fashion and the mold of form;
Mr. Josiah had the coat copied as exactly as might be;
that is all the story.</p>

<p class="indent">The little gentlemen had their plan of campaign
carefully laid out. They stepped through the long
rooms as quickly as Mr. Josiah&#39;s lameness allowed,
casting bird-like glances around them; they made their
bows as Meltiah Torrence had taught them in their
youth. &quot;Two steps forward, to first position; bend
from the hips, bob from the neck, recover; two steps
back! Dismiss!&quot; They delivered their speeches&mdash;not
quite as they intended, be it said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We congratulate you, Madam Flynt, on this festal
occasion!&quot; said Mr. Josiah. &quot;We thank you for the
honor of your invitation.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We have enjoyed ourselves extremely, we are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page133" id="page133"></a>[pg&nbsp;133]</span>
obliged to you,&quot; chimed in Mr. Jason, &quot;and we gratefully
take our leave.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Fortunately neither gentleman perceived that Mr.
Jason had said this instead of &quot;We are prepared to
enjoy ourselves extremely, and we gladly join the gay
circle!&quot; Madam Flynt heard, understood, and appreciated.
Their acknowledgments made, the Jebusites,
as Dr. Ross used to call them, proceeded to explore the
rooms, apparently with some special object in view.
Their bird-like glances flitted from side to side, growing
more and more anxious; they began to utter noises
as of mice in peril. Miss Croly came to the rescue.
&quot;The beautiful screen,&quot; she said, &quot;has been moved into
the hall, Mr. Jebuses. (One always addressed them
thus!) Madam Flynt feared that it might inconvenience&mdash;I
would say feared that the dancers might
injure it. It shows well in the hall!&quot; she added kindly.
The partners, with sounds as of mice relieved, fled to
the hall, where the object of their search stood against
the wall: a tall screen, covered with exquisite embroidery.
This they considered with minute and anxious
care.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There is less light here!&quot; said Mr. Josiah.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But everybody will see it!&quot; Mr. Jason consoled
him.</p>

<p class="indent">Finally, they spent the greater part of the evening
hovered about Mr. Josiah&#39;s <i>chef d&#39;&oelig;uvre</i> and enjoyed
themselves, as they had predicted, immensely.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Mallow and Mr. Jordano approached side by
side, and were welcomed with dignified cordiality.
They bent low before Madam Flynt; they gave separate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page134" id="page134"></a>[pg&nbsp;134]</span>
and very special bows to Kitty and me: hers
were the best, but I was not jealous.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&#39;ve got an elegant party, Madam!&quot; Mr. Mallow
glowed with civic and neighborly pride. &quot;I
don&#39;t know as any place but Cyrus could show such a
conjugation of pretty gals and handsome ladies.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A galaxy!&quot; exclaimed Mr. Jordano. &quot;A golden
galaxy! &#39;They walk in beauty like the night-tite-tite&mdash;&#39;
the second line escapes me! the poet Byron!
Miss Kitty, boona sarah, as we say in beautiful Italy.
Bella Italia, Miss Kitty! Bella Kitterina, also, if an
old friend may take the liberty. Very eleganto, I
must say.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Grazie tante</i>, Signor Jordano!&quot; Kitty smiled and
dimpled, and sent Mr. Jordano straight to the seventh
heaven. He did not follow the words, but that did
not matter; he was hearing Italian spoken by lovely
lips, and his gentle spirit soared ecstatic. He stepped
aside to make room for the Chanter girls who swept
in, like a white muslin billow, and after breaking in
curtseys to Madam Flynt, surged round Kitty and
me in shouting chorus. Mr. and Mrs. Chanter came
next, beaming good will on all; the three boys brought
up the rear. Bobby and Rodney had come over from
their college town on purpose; Aristides was in the
High School; all three were in love with Kitty, in
varying degrees of intensity, but Bobby&#39;s prior claim
was silently conceded by the other two. He was the
eldest; he had the Dress Suit (a gift from a distant
uncle whose inches could no longer be clipped within
it); he was captain of the college football team. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page135" id="page135"></a>[pg&nbsp;135]</span>
had been in love with Kitty as long as he could remember.
Of course, while Tom was &quot;round,&quot; Bobby
never had any hope, not even when his enchantress
used to call him &quot;Pretty Bobby Shafto,&quot; and sing a
little song, derisive but not unfriendly, about his being
fat and fair, which he was, and about his combing
down his yellow hair, which he might with advantage
have done oftener, and about his going to sea, silver
buckles at his knee, which was preposterous. When
Kitty, perched on top of the fence, would trill in her
silver voice,</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;He&#39;ll come back and marry me,</span><br />
<span class="i2">Pretty Bobby Shafto!&quot;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">the boy&#39;s honest heart thumped at his ribs, and his
cheeks grew redder, if that were possible. She was
Tommy&#39;s girl; he was perfectly loyal to Tommy; still&mdash;but
now that Tom was gone and no one ever heard
a word from him, Bobby saw no reason why his own
modest hopes might not soar; so soar they did.</p>

<p class="indent">Rodney and Aristides (the latter a chronic sufferer
from his name, which he loathed equally in its entirety
and in its customary abbreviation of &quot;Sty&quot;)
after making their bows, waited cheerfully for Bobby
to ask Kitty for the first dance, which he promptly
did. Rodney was just sidling up to claim the second
when Wilson Wibird, leaning over Kitty from behind,
laid a hand on the dance-card which hung from her
fan.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The rest are mine, Katrine!&quot; he murmured.</p>

<p class="indent">Kitty, turning, spoke crisply. &quot;Certainly not. Wilson!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page136" id="page136"></a>[pg&nbsp;136]</span>
Why should they be? Did you ask for the second,
Rodney? And you the third, Sty? I promised
Mr. Jordano one; you can have the fifth, Wilson, if
you like.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If I like! cruel Katrine!&quot; murmured Mr. Wibird.
He folded his arms and glared savagely at the three
Chanters, who smiled cheerfully at him and said in
chorus, &quot;Hello, Wilse! h&#39;are ye?&quot; Then he retired to
the wall, where he stood, his arms folded in a Napoleonic
attitude, his brows bent, his eyes following
Kitty as she glided about the room.</p>

<p class="indent">Wilson Wibird had made up his mind to marry
Kitty Ross, even before her return from Europe.
There was no other mate for him in Cyrus, he confided
to his one intimate, the greenish mirror that hung over
his dressing table. She was lovely; she was accomplished;
she had Mind and Taste; she could appreciate
him, and on her the name of Wibird might be bestowed
without derogation from its high descent. He
saw himself in fancy&mdash;Wilson lived largely in fancy&mdash;the
master of Ross House, welcoming his guests (and
Kitty&#39;s) with the stately courtesy of a gentleman of
the old school.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Katrine and I bid you welcome!&quot; he would say to
the mirror. &quot;The simple comforts of our home are
yours as long as you care to share them!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">His air was very noble, he thought, as he waved
his guests in. Now, Wilson was forced to acknowledge
that up to this time Kitty had shown little sense
of the honor he proposed to do her. He had met her
several times, and walked with her along the street,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page137" id="page137"></a>[pg&nbsp;137]</span>
but whenever he bestowed on her what he called a
flower of speech, he found that she had an errand in
the store they were passing. Sometimes he waited
for her, and she never came out, being indeed well
acquainted with the back door of every store on the
street&mdash;sometimes he &quot;punished&quot; her by stalking on
with bended brows. (Wilson loved bended brows;
he sometimes bended them so far that his little eyes
could hardly be seen; but this is by the way.) When
he called in the evening, Kitty was apt to be busy waiting
on her aunt, or else those Chanter girls were there.
Altogether, Wilson felt that his suit was not prospering
as it should: this, he told the mirror, must
cease. She would set her will to his, forsooth! pretty
birdling! She should see what it meant to thwart
a man with a chin like that. He motioned toward
his image. He must assert himself. Some lines of
poetry came to his mind; lines which he had felt, the
first time he read them, to describe himself:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;He was a strong man from the north,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Light-locked, with eyes of dangerous gray.&quot;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">The poem went on to tell how the strong man took
the lady in his strong white arms and bore her on his
horse away. It was a fine poem. That, Wilson felt,
was the attitude for him; he had been too gentle, too
<i>debonair</i>; now she must feel his power. He had
thought to impress it upon her by dancing with her
through the entire evening. He had seen himself
folding her in his strong white arms (decently hid in
conventional black) floating through the glittering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page138" id="page138"></a>[pg&nbsp;138]</span>
halls to the sound of voluptuous music. Now the music
was sounding; old Meltiah Torrence scraping away
at his old fiddle, his son Jabez squeaking on the cornet.
It was our own, our only &quot;music&quot;; we loved it,
but voluptuous is hardly the word for it. The music
was sounding, and Wilson Wibird, instead of carrying
out his program, was standing against the wall
with folded arms and bended brows.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Mallow saw him and crossed the room to where
he stood. &quot;Why ain&#39;t you dancin&#39;, Wilse?&quot; he inquired;
and without waiting for a reply: &quot;Go and
take Lissy out for a turn! Nobody&#39;s asked her, and
she admires dancin&#39;. Ain&#39;t enough boys to go round.
You go and take her out! Oh! hemp! nothin&#39; at all,
Very! nothin&#39; at all!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Jordano, backing down the room with Miss
Almeria Bygood, had come to the end of it sooner
than he expected, and his heel had come down with
some force on Mr. Mallow&#39;s toe. Wilson took advantage
of his uncle&#39;s momentary anguish to slip away,
but he did not take Melissa out. He folded his arms
and bended his brows against another part of the
wall, where Kitty could not fail to see him as she
passed. It was good Bobby Chanter who took Melissa
out; I rather think he would have done it even without
Kitty&#39;s breathless little, &quot;Oh, no, Bobby; I must stop
now. Do take out Melissa, there&#39;s a dear!&quot; Bobby
was a kind boy, and Melissa&#39;s face had been very
wistful as she watched the dancing. A pretty face,
if it could be filled out a little; the thin cheeks were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page139" id="page139"></a>[pg&nbsp;139]</span>
flushed to-night, and the hazel eyes sparkled above the
pretty pink challis, Uncle Marshall&#39;s gift.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You make it tasty!&quot; he bade Anne Peace. &quot;Make it
as tasty as any of &#39;em! put on plenty of gimp, or galloon,
or whatever the style is. I want Lissy dressed as
nice as any gal there. You make her look like Venus
Dimedici, that travelin&#39; man was talkin&#39; about. He
said she was great.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Mallow&#39;s rendering of the title of Venus made
every <i>i</i> long. Miss Peace had her own opinion of
Venus, but reserved it, and promised to do her best;
which she certainly had done.</p>

<p class="indent">People came and came, and came. All Cyrus, of
course, in its shining best: Mrs. Scatter in green poplin,
Miss Pringle in blue; the Misses Caddie dressed
alike in &quot;that brown silk that was so fashionable one
season&mdash;don&#39;t you remember? And then went out so
sudden, and Hanks has been trying to get rid of the
piece ever since. He put it down to half price directly
Madam Flynt&#39;s invitations were out, and the Caddies
took it and made it up themselves. There was four
yards more than the pattern called for, but they took it
all, so they could make over; and then if they didn&#39;t
put every scrap of it into the skirt so &#39;twould fade
alike! They stand out like penwipers, don&#39;t they?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Thus Mrs. Bagley to her husband, who said, &quot;Yes!
yes! very tasty! very tasty!&quot; being absorbed in the
problem of how much &quot;Acme astral&quot; it would take to
light these rooms, and what possibility there might
be of persuading Madam Flynt to try it instead of
candles.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page140" id="page140"></a>[pg&nbsp;140]</span>
Tinkham and Tupham came, in long barges: the
former a little amused, a little patronizing as usual:
patronizing not of Madam Flynt, but of Cyrus in
general and Kitty in particular.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Drives a cab, or so I understand. Yes! a sad
come-down for an old family. I understand the aunt
has come on to give countenance to it: you remember
her; Johanna Ross; always peculiar!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">This attitude, whispered in the dressing room (to
the silent rage of Miss Anne Peace, who longed to
stick into Tinkham the pins she drew from its skirts
and veils) rustled down the stairs and into the drawing-room,
but appeared to evaporate at sight of Kitty
and the beryl necklace.</p>

<p class="indent">Tupham was, as usual, hearty and friendly; pleased
at being asked, and eager to &quot;take in the whole show&quot;
for the benefit of those at home. Thus female Tupham
managed to slide an appraising thumb and finger
over Kitty&#39;s satin, &quot;thick as a board, my dear, and
soft&mdash;well, there!&quot; while male Tupham made a point
of sampling every item of food and drink with strict
impartiality.</p>

<p class="indent">Corona College arrived rather late, in a somewhat
superior, if not Tinkhamesque frame of mind. Madam
Flynt, ever thoughtful, had bidden Bobby Chanter
pick out ten nice boys for her, which he had done with
anxious care. They had had a merry drive over, and
were under the impression that they had come partly
to please good old Bagpipes (a subtle rendering of
Bobby&#39;s name), partly, perhaps unconsciously, to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page141" id="page141"></a>[pg&nbsp;141]</span>
amuse themselves with the would-be graces of a rustic
community.</p>

<p class="indent">A fragment of trialogue, overheard near the drawing-room
door, conveys the attitude of these young
gentlemen:</p>

<p class="indent"><i>A.</i> &quot;Pink muslin one rather neat: what?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><i>B.</i> &quot;So-so; not too! blue one has more go to her.
P&#39;raps she&#39;s the lady cab-driver: they have one here,
I&#39;m told. Trot her out, what say? Put her through
her paces!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><i>C.</i> &quot;Get on to the little thing with curls! She&#39;s quite
a daisy. Think I must give her a turn.&quot; (Thank you,
sir! This was my humble self.)</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">&quot;Jerusalem!</span><br />
<span class="i0"><i>A. B. C.</i> in sudden trio.  &quot;Great Scott! <i>Who is that</i></span><br />
<span class="i4">&quot;By George!</span><br />
</div>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i4"><i>ripping</i></span><br />
<span class="i0"><i>perfectly stunning girl in green?</i> I say, Bobs! Bags!</span><br />
<span class="i4"><i>screaming</i></span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">Pipes! <span class="smcap">Chanter!</span> Won&#39;t you introduce me? Oh, I
<i>say</i>, Bobby! I&#39;m your friend! Don&#39;t go back on me!&quot;
etc., etc. Thus Corona in frantic whispers, plucking
at Bobby Chanter, who swelled in serene pride, and
was entirely kind to his friends, knowing Kitty&#39;s next
dance to be his.</p>

<p class="indent">Kitty was kind to them too, and gave them an &quot;extra&quot;
when she could, but mostly had to meet their impassioned
pleadings with a smile and &quot;So sorry! I am
engaged, but do let me find you a partner!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The collegians were nice, gentlemanly boys; we
all had a delightful time, and I truly think they did.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page142" id="page142"></a>[pg&nbsp;142]</span>
But here I may note a curious little by-product of the
Party. For weeks after, Corona College had much
business to transact in Cyrus. It came by train, one
by one, and was observed to look eagerly about it
on arrival, and to make hurried inquiry for a cab.
Confronted by John Tucker, serenely yet critically observant,
it suddenly decided it would walk, and proceeded
to stroll about the village, investigating the
shops and making aimless purchases, till the return
train. Corona rarely met Kitty; the between-trains
hour was just when she was taking Madam Flynt for
her airing. Now and then, however, say on a rainy
day, some happy youth would chance upon her, and
walk home with her, and perhaps be asked in for a
cup of tea, and return to Corona in a state of rapturous
distraction very trying to his mates who had
been dutifully practising football.</p>

<p class="indent">But here is a long digression: let us hurry back to
the Party.</p>

<p class="indent">Among the revolving couples, none attracted more
attention than Miss Almeria and Mr. Jordano, already
mentioned. They danced the Boston Dip, seldom
seen in these degenerate days. It is a slow,
graceful waltz, very becoming to tall figures and
sweeping velvet skirts. Mr. Jordano held his chin high;
his eyes were nearly closed, a narrow slit only enabling
him to pilot his partner safely through the
dance; his expression, which totally belied him, was
one of haughty arrogance. His lips moved constantly;
one would have supposed he was murmuring caustic
comments on the other dancers; instead, he was saying,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page143" id="page143"></a>[pg&nbsp;143]</span>
&quot;One, two, three, <i>one</i>, two, three!&quot; in time, if
not in tune, with the music. Miss Almeria&#39;s glossy
braids bent gracefully over her partner&#39;s shoulder:
her look was benign; she wore a slight, indulgent
smile, as who should say, &quot;Dancing is not what it
was, but perhaps it is well for people to see occasionally
what it can be.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Madam Flynt was enjoying her party immensely.
Her eyes followed the dancers continuously. Kitty,
of course, was the most delightful person to watch,
but they all looked happy, and youth was not everything.
Almeria held her own as well as anybody,
and Egeria was hardly less graceful. Now if Johanna
Ross hadn&#39;t a bee in her bonnet, she might be dancing
with Edward Peters. She did not suggest this to
the Judge, who was sitting beside her; she received his
congratulations amiably. She was glad he thought it
a pretty party; yes, the rooms did light up well. People
with good rooms had a responsibility to Society&mdash;Madam
Flynt leaned nearer the Judge, and her voice
dropped.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course, Edward, in a City, one might have
thought&mdash;it might not have seemed proper to give
Kitty a party so soon after&mdash;you understand! But
everybody in Cyrus knows just how it is; and her not
wearing black and all; but&mdash;well, if you must know, it
was the Doctor made me do it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dr. Pettijohn?&quot; naming the Tinkham practitioner
who had ministered to Cyrus&#39; few ailments since Dr.
Ross&#39;s death.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No! no! our own Doctor&mdash;Dr. Ross, of course!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page144" id="page144"></a>[pg&nbsp;144]</span>
I don&#39;t mean&mdash;I am no spiritualist, Edward, if that
is why you are raising your left eyebrow!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Judge Peters blushed and lowered the eyebrow.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But it really is curious. Let me tell you! Several
years ago, a young cousin came to visit me: Selina
Hazelton: you may remember her. Her father had
been ill, she may have had troubles of her own; in
fact&mdash;but you shall hear. Anyhow, she drooped and
drooped. I couldn&#39;t make her eat, and she didn&#39;t
seem to care for anything; dreadful state she was in,
and getting worse. So I sent for Dr. Ross, and he
looked her over. Then I sent her out on an errand,
and asked what he would advise. Would he give her
a tonic? &#39;Give her a dance!&#39; he said. &#39;Why Doctor!&#39;
I said. &#39;She can hardly walk, much less dance. Just
to cross the street seems to tire her out. <i>I</i> think iron
and wine is what she needs.&#39; I always told him what
I thought; he called me his consulting physician, you
know: dear Doctor! Well, he said again, &#39;Give her a
dance!&#39; insisted on it, saying he got the idea out of
Charles Reade. You know he was daft about Charles
Reade. Well, my dear&mdash;friend, I <i>did</i> give her a dance.
Invited all the college boys I knew; and they all came,
and one beside. Georgie Hathaway asked if he might
bring a friend, and I said yes, of course. Friend
came; nice-looking lad; Porter, his name was. Well,
when I saw the color he and Selina went, one white,
the other greenish-purple, I knew what had been the
matter with the child. They danced every dance together
but two, and those they sat out on the woodbox
in the upper hall. And I giving the party for her!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page145" id="page145"></a>[pg&nbsp;145]</span>
Next day they were engaged&mdash;I was <i>so</i> surprised, of
course! In two months they were married, and now
they have three children and are as happy as June
crickets. Well! so&mdash;now I come to the curious thing.
You know how gay Kitty is&mdash;a gallant kind of gayety
that makes me cry sometimes!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Judge nodded. Kitty passed at that moment,
dancing with Mr. Mallow, who handed her about as
if she were a cream tart on a gold dish. The Judge&#39;s
eyes rested very tenderly on the girl.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well!&quot; Madam Flynt bent still nearer till her
lilac cap ribbons touched the Judge&#39;s fine gray hair.
&quot;I was thinking about her one evening, about ten days
ago; and all of a sudden I seemed to hear Doctor
speaking, as plain as I hear you to-night. &#39;Give her a
dance!&#39; he said. &#39;Give her a dance!&#39; Now I am no
spiritualist, Edward, but&mdash;what do you want, Cornelia
Croly? I have told you that I will <i>not</i> be hovered
over. You may be a hen turkey, but I am <i>not</i>&mdash;what
is it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Croly set her thin lips and advanced with a
look of humble resolution. &quot;Clarissa,&quot; she said firmly,
&quot;there is a draught!&quot; and she folded the crape shawl
round Madam Flynt&#39;s ample shoulders. Madam
Flynt is a large woman, usually deliberate in her
movements; but in the twinkling of an eye the shawl
was whisked off, rolled in a ball, and handed to Judge
Peters.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Put that under my chair, will you, Edward?&quot; said
the lady. &quot;<i>Well</i> under, so that nobody can get at it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page146" id="page146"></a>[pg&nbsp;146]</span>
Cornelia, I shall be obliged if you will go and see about
supper. Time it was announced!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Madam Flynt&#39;s supper ought to have a whole chapter
to itself, but that may not be. It was a wonderful
and delightful supper, and never was feast more
thoroughly enjoyed. Kitty and I sat with the Chanters;
such a merry time as we had! Sarepta had made
the chicken salad, Sarah the croquettes, Abby Ann the
coffee and rolls: as for the ice-cream, Bobby insisted
that all the good fairies in the Fairy Book must have
taken a turn at it; it was too good to be the work of
earthly hands. Bobby glowed till you could have
warmed your hands at him. His radiance was not
lessened by the sight of Wilson Wibird glowering
across the room.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Poor Wilse!&quot; he chuckled. &quot;Supper doesn&#39;t seem
to agree with him! Gee! it does with me, though! This
salad suits my complaint first-rate: I wouldn&#39;t wonder
but I got well now. Let me get you some more,
Kitty!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Kitty&#39;s kind heart smote her a little at sight of
Wilson&#39;s tragic face. Had she been <i>too</i> horrid to him?
She was almost sorry she hadn&#39;t another dance, though
it was odious to be held so tight, and he <i>would</i> bump
into one with his knees.</p>

<p class="indent">There were no more dances for Kitty that night.
Her own party though it was, she had firmly refused
to let it interfere with business. Directly after supper
she slipped away, after a whisper in Madam Flynt&#39;s
ear that brought the tears to the good lady&#39;s eyes,
and made her even speak mildly when Miss Croly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page147" id="page147"></a>[pg&nbsp;147]</span>
thought more ice-cream would not be good for her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can get it myself, Cornelia,&quot; she said, &quot;if you
don&#39;t feel equal to the exertion. Or here is Mr. Jordano.
Mr. Jordano, will you be so kind as to bring
me some more ice-cream? Thank you! on the whole
I&#39;ll have frozen pudding!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Kitty, I say, slipped away, and in twenty minutes
was back in her fur coat and cap, nodding brightly to
the first departing guests. These were the Bygoods,
who feared Father had already been up too long beyond
his usual time; it was long since he had passed
so delightful an evening.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;&#39;The gay, the gay and festive throng,</span><br />
<span class="i0">The halls, the halls of dazzling light!&#39;&quot;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">he quoted happily.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you never asked me to dance, Mr. Bygood!&quot;
said Kitty. &quot;If <i>you</i> had asked me for the reel, I&#39;d
have stayed!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh! oh, te-hee! te-hee!&quot; quavered Mr. Bygood.
&quot;I fear I might have reeled more than I should, Kitty,&mdash;though
sober, my dear, though sober! New cider
never hurt any one, and our amiable hostess assured
me it was not twenty-four hours old.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Where had Wilson Wibird got hold of something
stronger than new cider? Not at Madam Flynt&#39;s, certainly;
yet this is what Kitty told me next day. Coming
back from her last trip, at her own corner she
came upon Wilson standing on the curbstone balancing
himself and looking very forlorn. He called to
her. He had lost his overshoes, and the snow was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page148" id="page148"></a>[pg&nbsp;148]</span>
deep. &quot;Could you give me a lift, Katrine?&quot; he asked
plaintively, the conqueror in him subdued by wet feet,
which he hated as a cat does.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you&#39;ll promise not to call me &#39;Katrine&#39;!&quot; was on
Kitty&#39;s lips; but she checked herself. She <i>had</i> been
horrid to him; at her own party, too, when she ought
to have been nice to everybody. &quot;Weedy, seedy,
needy&mdash;&quot; &quot;Think shame of yourself!&quot; said Kitty to
Kitty. Then aloud, &quot;Very well, Wilson! I&#39;ll take you,
though it&#39;s pretty late. Jump in!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The weather had cleared, and the night was so
glorious that for the latest guests, all young and vigorous,
Kitty had insisted on shifting over to Pilot
and the open sleigh, and sending John Tucker home
to his Mary, who had chosen this evening to have a
&quot;spell.&quot; Pilot thought it was time for a warm mash
and bed; he sped swiftly through the white silent
streets, where only an upper window here and there
twinkled its assurance that the event of the season
was over. The Wibirds lived at the other end of the
village; Mrs. Wibird and Melissa had been among
the early departures in the warm hooded sleigh behind
Dan.</p>

<p class="indent">Seated beside Kitty, wrapped in the same fur robe,
Wilson felt the strong man from the north revive
within him. The keen frosty air went to his head;
or had something else gone there before? When
Kitty, wishing to be kind to this forlornity, turned
to him with &quot;Hasn&#39;t it been a delightful evening, Wilson?&quot;
she was met by a burning glance (again, she
would have called it a leer!) and a husky voice exclaiming,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page149" id="page149"></a>[pg&nbsp;149]</span>
&quot;Now, this moment, the evening begins!
Katrine! my hour dawns!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t be silly, Wilson!&quot; she said curtly, but Wilson
 swept on,</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are beside me. I feel your presence, your
gaze intoss-toxicates, Katrine! Together, thus, let us
speed on through the night&quot;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">&quot;Kitty!&quot; I cried, &quot;you frighten me! What <i>did</i> you
do?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My dear, it was perfectly simple. You know there
is rather a sharp corner at the end of the street? We
were near it. I cut it a little sharper, that&#39;s all. Up
went one runner, out went Master Wilson into a nice
soft drift. I was sorry to lower Pilot&#39;s opinion of my
driving, but it was really the only thing to do. But
that is the last time I shall be sorry for Wilson Wibird.
Odious little atomy!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Which shows that even strong men from the north
do not always see themselves as others see them.</p>

<p class="h2">CHAPTER XI<br />
<span class="smcap">on the rialto</span></p>

<p class="indent">Cyrus rises early as a rule, though the definition
of the adverb varies. Six is my hour;
I hold it a good one, winter and summer. But
if I have ever mentioned this to City friends who get
up at eight, with the purring contentment that early
risers feel and that late risers scorn, I do so no more,
since hearing the following fragment of dialogue between
two Cyrus women:</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. A.: &quot;What time did it happen?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. B.: &quot;Oh! we was all up. &#39;Twas four or five
o&#39;clock; &#39;twas late!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Collective Cyrus, that part of it at least that went
to Madam Flynt&#39;s party, allowed itself an extra half
hour the following morning; all but two people. With
the earliest morning red, Mrs. Sharpe and Cissy leaped
from their beds, prepared and swallowed a hasty
breakfast, flung on their &quot;things,&quot; and rushed out into
the street. They wasted no time in speech beyond
a few exclamatory remarks while dressing. No
words were needed between them: they knew what
they knew. Behooved that the World should know.
In the street they separated, one going north, one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page151" id="page151"></a>[pg&nbsp;151]</span>
south. Since we cannot follow both, let us take the
mother.</p>

<p class="indent">The first person Mrs. Sharpe met was Jim Ruff, the
one-armed milkman, whistling his way cheerily along.
Jim was born with one arm, and never could for the
life of him see what folks wanted of two. In his off
hours he was a nurse, and in great demand among
old gentlemen of rheumatic tendencies who liked to
have &quot;a rub and a lift&quot; at bed-time. Mrs. Sharpe
leapt into the roadway, beckoning: Jim checked his
horse.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good morning, Jim! Only a pint this morning,
please; we&#39;ve had breakfast. Leave it inside the storm
door, will you? Have you heard the news?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not a word!&quot; Jim leaned over the dasher sociably.
&quot;Nice party, was it? The cream was all right anyway,
I bet!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very nice! very nice!&quot; Mrs. Sharpe waved the
cream away hastily. &quot;But what is the outcome, I
ask you? What comes of dancing and jigging and
feasting? <i>Destruction!</i> Kitty Ross has eloped with Wilson
Wibird!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>What!</i>&quot; People did not, as a rule, pay much attention
to Mrs. Sharpe, but the milkman was startled
out of his usual calm.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What you say, Mis&#39; Sharpe?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They have <i>eloped</i>!&quot; she repeated. &quot;Kitty Ross
and Wilson Wibird! I saw them with these eyes.
Isn&#39;t it awful? What did I always say? But I won&#39;t
keep you, Jim!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She waved her hand as if stricken speechless; in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page152" id="page152"></a>[pg&nbsp;152]</span>
reality, she had spied Mr. Cheeseman, stumping along
to take down his shutters and open shop. Him she
attacked with such suddenness that he almost dropped
his pipe.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let me prepare you for a shock!&quot; cried the lady.
&quot;You are an aged man, Mr. Cheeseman, and your
nerves are easy shook. What I have to tell might
strike an aged person into palsy, I wouldn&#39;t wonder.
There has been an <i>elopement</i> in Cyrus! a wicked, terrible
elopement! Oh! what I say is, shall we ever hold
up our heads again? When I think of what Tinkham
will say!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">(Mrs. Sharpe came from Tinkham; we were too
polite as a rule to say that that accounted for her.)</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t know what Tinkham will say,&quot; snapped
Mr. Cheeseman, &quot;nor I don&#39;t care. Cyrus will most
likely say it ain&#39;t so. Who&#39;s eloped, I&#39;d like to know!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Kitty Ross and Wilson Wibird!&quot; The lady&#39;s thin
neck shot forward, serpent-wise, as she hissed out the
names. Mr. Cheeseman received the shock calmly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t believe a word of it!&quot; he said.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You don&#39;t! You don&#39;t believe the witness of these
eyes? I tell you I <i>saw</i> them, the two of them, after
midnight, in a sleigh, dashing through Cyrus Street,
like&mdash;like flames of fire. The hoss was gallopin&#39;:
they was fairly rushin&#39; to their doom. Don&#39;t say you
don&#39;t believe me, Mr. Cheeseman, because sight is
sight, and I am not blind.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, nor dumb!&quot; Mr. Cheeseman was not a patient
man. &quot;Likely the hoss got roused up, waitin&#39;
in the cold. I always tell Kitty she drives too tarnal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page153" id="page153"></a>[pg&nbsp;153]</span>
fast. Wish you good mornin&#39;, Mis&#39; Sharpe.&quot;
And he stumped on, resuming his interrupted pipe in
short, irritated puffs.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Sharpe looked after him with a snort, half
pitying, half contemptuous, and sped on her way. By
this time the male part of Cyrus was trooping down
to business. In half an hour every man in the street
had heard with varying emotions that Kitty Ross had
eloped with Wilson Wibird. I don&#39;t know that anybody
exactly believed it; at least, no one was found
who confessed afterward to having done so, but the
Street certainly had an uncomfortable half hour till
the counter report reached it; namely, that Wilson
Wibird was lying in his bed, wounded and bleeding
from a frightful accident with one of them wild hosses
of Kitty Ross&#39;s. He had been hove out, and the hoss
had gone off at a tearing gallop, and where Kitty was
this minute no human being prob&#39;ly knew. Likely she
had been dragged to her death, and they would track
her by the blood&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">You see, Cissy had gone straight to the Wibirds&#39;,
secretly determined for once to &quot;get ahead of
Mumma.&quot; Mrs. Wibird had been naturally perturbed
at seeing her son &quot;hove out&quot; (it was at their own corner
that the incident occurred) and at his stumbling
into the house some minutes later, bleeding profusely,
and in a savage humor. It was no wonder perhaps
that she made the most of what she had seen, but she
ought to have made it clear, as Melissa did afterward,
that Wilson&#39;s bleeding was from the nose.
The two reports met at Bygood&#39;s, like the two halves
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page154" id="page154"></a>[pg&nbsp;154]</span>
of a chemical formula. The gentlemen had just come
in for their morning papers, and it seethed end bubbled
around them. Judge Peters said &quot;Pish!&quot; Mr.
Mallow said &quot;Bosh!&quot; Mr. Jordano waved his note-book
in a composite frenzy of anxiety, incredulity
and professional excitement, and murmured unintelligible
sounds ending in &quot;O&quot;. Italian, he always maintained,
was the natural language of the emotions. The
result of all this was that by eleven o&#39;clock (&quot;Earlier
than that would not be decent, sir! not decent, after a
party! The child is probably in bed, and the best place
for her!&quot; thus Judge Peters, very erect over his
black satin stock), by eleven o&#39;clock, I say, the Judge
and Mr. Mallow were posting up the hill toward
Ross House. Wholly improbable that anything was
out of the way; those women ought to get thirty days,
sir, and learn to govern their tongues! But if there
<i>were</i> anything, these two, as old family friends, were
manifestly the ones to look into it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We&#39;ll let you know, Very,&quot; said Mr. Mallow
kindly, &quot;if there&#39;s anything for you in it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Jordano, still waving his notebook, thanked
him, fervently, and turned to minister to Mr. Bygood,
to whom the effervescence had penetrated, causing
him great alarm. The ladies had not yet appeared:
Mr. Jordano hovered about the old gentleman, adjuring
him to be calm and murmuring, &quot;No periloso!
no dangeroso! Cheer up-pup-pup, my venerable
friend; all will be right-tite-tite!&quot; in a manner equally
agitated and agitating.</p>

<p class="indent">The Judge and &quot;the Mine Host,&quot; as the <i>Centinel</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page155" id="page155"></a>[pg&nbsp;155]</span>
loved to call him, were not the first callers at Ross
House. Bobby Chanter, speeding down the hill to his
morning train, met Cissy&#39;s half of the chemical formula
on the way; threw Education to the dogs, and
sped back up the hill at a rate that brought him to
Ross House crimson and breathless. His furious ring
producing Sarepta Darwin in a state of high tension,
he could only gape at her, and gasp, &quot;All right?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Now this was no morning to gape at Sarepta. In
the first place, she had slaved like three niggers, as
she expressed it, the day before, had got to bed long
after midnight, and been kept awake long after that,
recalling the way Kitty had looked and the way &quot;the
folks&quot; had looked at her. In the second place, she
had already been bothered enough by Jim Ruff, who
had no business that she knew of to inquire minutely
into the state of Kitty&#39;s health, wanting to know if
Sarepta had seen her this morning, and what time she
got home. He got a flea in <i>his</i> ear all right, Sarepta
reflected comfortably; now she was fully ready for
the next intruder.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All right?&quot; she said with acerbity. &quot;All wrong, I
should say, from the looks of you! Ain&#39;t you
ashamed, Bobby Chanter, at this time in the morning?
Go home and tell your Pa, and see what he&#39;ll say to
you! The idea! You&#39;re a disgrace!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She was shutting the door, but Bobby was not a
football player for nothing. An adroit foot checked
the door in its closing, and the next moment a broad
shoulder pressed through the opening, followed by the
whole person of a very vigorous young man. Bobby
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page156" id="page156"></a>[pg&nbsp;156]</span>
shut the door and stood against it: he had got his
breath by this time; also, it was evident from Sarepta&#39;s
aspect that no disaster had come to the house.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t be crusty, Sarepta!&quot; he said coaxingly.
&quot;Tell me how Kitty is after the party! There&#39;s nothing
the matter with me!&quot; he added, &quot;and I&#39;m your
friend, you know, Sarepta! I always was.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Sarepta&#39;s iron face relaxed: it was true. With
the sole exception of Kitty, she thought little of girls,
had been heard to say that she wouldn&#39;t be bothered
raisin&#39; &#39;em: but she liked a good-looking boy, and
Bobby was undeniably good-looking. Before she could
speak, however, a clear voice sounded from the stairway.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How Kitty is? Very well, I thank you, Bobby
Shafto!&quot; and there was Kitty herself coming downstairs,
so distractingly pretty in her brown corduroy
suit that Bobby&#39;s feelings flew &quot;all ways to once&#39;t,&quot;
like Huldy&#39;s in &quot;The Courtin&#39;.&quot; She was too adorable!
Bobby wanted to go down on his knees then
and there, among the walking-sticks and the Christmas
greens, and cry out that she was his queen, and
that he would rather be under her little lovely feet
than on a king&#39;s throne. But Bobby was twenty-three
years old and a senior at Corona College.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;All right, are you, Kitty?&quot; he asked. &quot;I&mdash;I
thought I&#39;d just inquire as I went to the train.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bobby! the train has gone! I heard it whistle
just as you rang the bell. Won&#39;t you catch it from
the dean? Come into the sitting-room!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Muttering that he couldn&#39;t stop, Bobby came in;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page157" id="page157"></a>[pg&nbsp;157]</span>
would not sit down, but leaned against the door with
an air of elaborate detachment.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Got home all right, Kitty? It was mean of you
not to let me see you home.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t you think I had earned a little solitude,
Bobby? I didn&#39;t get it though!&quot; Kitty&#39;s eyes twinkled.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What do you mean? We were the last load, you
said.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, you were! but I met Wilson, and he had lost
his rubbers, and looked so forlorn, I <i>had</i> to take him
home, Bobby, when he asked me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He didn&#39;t!&quot; Bobby&#39;s cheek flushed. &quot;The impudent
shrimp!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Impudent shrimpudent!&quot; said Kitty, and then remembered
that she had never played rhymes with
Bobby.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&mdash;I didn&#39;t take him quite all the way!&quot; she began,
and then broke into a peal of laughter so clear and
joyous that Sarepta had to make a special errand&mdash;a
stick of wood, it was, which the fire did not need&mdash;to
see what was up.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Glad you didn&#39;t! of all the cheek I ever heard of!
I wish I&#39;d been there. How did you get rid of him,
Kitty?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why&mdash;I ought not to tell, Bobby. Promise never
to tell anybody! Promise, Sarepta! Well&mdash;Wilson
felt a little sentimental after the party and all, and I&mdash;I&mdash;tipped
him out, going round the corner!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ha! ha! ha!&quot; roared Bobby Shafto.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page158" id="page158"></a>[pg&nbsp;158]</span>
&quot;He! he! he!&quot; tittered Sarepta, and fled, her bread
being in the oven.</p>

<p class="indent">Kitty held out her hands with a sudden gesture,
Bobby grasped them, and the two danced up and
down, holding hands and laughing like two children.
Kitty ought to have known better. There are so
many psycho-chemical formulae; they combine so
easily, especially with certain cardiac conditions. She
knew perfectly well that Bobby had been sighing and
looking and sighing again, ever since she came back.
I am afraid she was rather used to sighs and looks.
She had spoken casually of &quot;people&quot; in Switzerland
and Italy who had been &quot;rather foolish.&quot; She knew,
or she ought to have known, that it was one thing to
dance with a lad at the party, one revolving unit
among many, and a wholly different thing to take
hands with that lad and dance child-fashion, just the
two of them in all the world. What wonder that
poor Bobby Shafto was swept out to sea in good
earnest? He could not know that the girl was not
really thinking of him at all, that she was dancing
with Tommy Lee, as she always had danced, ever
since she could toddle.</p>

<p class="indent">Kitty saw the look in Bobby&#39;s eyes, and a cold wave
swept over her. She would have withdrawn her
hands, but Bobby held them tight.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Kitty!&quot; The laughter died out of his rosy face.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Kitty, dear!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, Bobby! we must stop now, and you must run
along; I have my housekeeping to see to.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page159" id="page159"></a>[pg&nbsp;159]</span>
&quot;Kitty, dear! wait just a minute. I&mdash;I want&mdash;I
wish I might hold these little hands all the time!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Kitty tried to laugh. &quot;Can&#39;t be done, Bobby,&quot; she
said, &quot;it would interfere with my driving. Let me go,
please, there&#39;s a good Bobby Shafto!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But Bobby could not be stopped now. &quot;I must
tell you!&quot; he cried. &quot;I <i>have</i> to! I love you so, Kitty,
I can&#39;t think of anything else. And it isn&#39;t all selfishness,
dear. I want to take care of you. I won&#39;t have
you exposed to insults from a miserable chump like
Wilson Wibird. I shall be out of college next year,
Kitty, and I have a good job promised me; won&#39;t you&mdash;won&#39;t
you let me take care of you, my dear?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Kitty was grave enough now. Her gray eyes were
full of tender kindness, as they looked straight into
the boy&#39;s burning blue ones; but at that kind look, the
cold wave swept over him, too.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dear Bobby! dear, good friend! no! it can never,
never be. No! don&#39;t say any more. Let me go, <i>please</i>,
my dear!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He dropped her hands, and turned away with a little
broken sound. It was not quite a sob, but it went
straight to Kitty&#39;s heart. Cruel, wicked girl that she
had been! This was her friend, Tommy&#39;s friend,
from petticoat-days. Was this the best she could do
for him?</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bobby,&quot; she said quietly, &quot;come into the sitting-room
a minute! I have something to say to you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Bobby followed her mutely, with hanging head.
She beckoned him to a seat beside her on the leather
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page160" id="page160"></a>[pg&nbsp;160]</span>
sofa. She was trembling, but she managed with an
effort to steady her voice.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We have been friends all our lives, Bobby!&quot; she
said. &quot;I am going to be honest with you; it is the
least thing I can do, and the only thing. If you think
a little, Bobby Shafto, perhaps&mdash;you will see why I
cannot&mdash;cannot care in the way you mean, my poorest
Bobby. Think back a little! There&mdash;there used
to be three of us; don&#39;t you remember?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Her voice sank almost to a whisper, but her eyes
were brave and honest. Bobby looked into them: then
he hung his head: the comely red ebbed out of his
face, leaving it very pale.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&mdash;I wouldn&#39;t have spoken at all if he had been
here!&quot; he muttered. &quot;Of course I wouldn&#39;t! but&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know you wouldn&#39;t, dear! And, oh, Bobby, I
may never see him again. He may be dead, or&mdash;or&mdash;he
may never think about me at all, he may care for
somebody else: think of all the girls he has met since
he went away! but&mdash;but you see, Bobby, there will
never be any one else for me.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">When Bobby had gone away sadly down the hill,
Kitty ran up to her room and had a good solid cry,
a thing she rarely indulged in.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tommy!&quot; sobbed the girl, and she stretched out
her young lonely arms to the empty air. &quot;Tommy,
I do want you so! Aren&#39;t you ever coming? Don&#39;t you
really care? I want my Duke of Lee! Oh, how happy
would this gentlewoman be, to be blessed with her
Duke&#39;s good company! Oh! oh!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">By and by she got the better of herself, dried her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page161" id="page161"></a>[pg&nbsp;161]</span>
eyes, washed her face, and was cheerful Kitty again.
Then she did an absurd thing: Kitty <i>was</i> absurd,
there was no denying that. She went to the long glass
and curtsied to her image: then, gravely and formally,
she proceeded to dance the &quot;Duke of Lee,&quot; stepping
high, stepping low, tossing her pretty head, waving
her pretty arms, all as carefully and precisely as if
a partner had been bowing and pirouetting opposite
her. While she danced, she sang the song from end
to end; sang it so clear and sweet (barring one little
sob in the middle) that Aunt Johanna, in her bed,
wiped her eyes and thanked goodness some one was
happy in the world; and Sarepta Darwin in the kitchen
sniffed, and forgot for the moment the dreadful fact
of her having got too deep a bake on them loaves,
l&#39;iterin&#39; in the parlor with them triflin&#39; children.</p>

<p class="indent">As the last &quot;Marry oo, diddy goo, diddy goo!&quot; died
away, the doorbell rang, and Kitty went down, cheerfully,
to receive Judge Peters and Mr. Mallow.</p>

<p class="indent">The gentlemen had just called in passing to ask how
Kitty found herself after the party: quite unnecessary
to ask, on seeing her, said the Judge, but they
thought they would call. What a delightful party!
Madam Flynt always did things well. That was so!
Mr. Mallow opined. She had a genus for soci&#39;ty, no
two ways about that. Used to entertain a great deal
in the Colonel&#39;s time; Colonel was social, too. Great
thing to have the house open again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Got home all right, did you, Kitty?&quot; Mr. Mallow
bolted from the carefully circuitous path laid
down by the Judge.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page162" id="page162"></a>[pg&nbsp;162]</span>
&quot;All right, thank you, Mr. Mallow! It cleared off
fine, you know, and I took Pilot and the open sleigh
for the last few loads. It was such fun!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pilot is a fine horse!&quot; the Judge nodded the approval
of a connoisseur. &quot;A spirited animal! a trifle
hard-bitted, is he, Kitty?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Kind o&#39; fresh last night, was he? Cold night and
all; don&#39;t blame him a mite!&quot; chimed in Mr. Mallow.</p>

<p class="indent">Kitty looked from one to the other; her eyes began
to twinkle.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What&#39;s the matter?&quot; she asked. &quot;Did I drive too
fast for somebody? You know Father always called
me a daughter of Jehu, Judge. Have you come to
arrest me for fast driving? Is it to be fine or imprisonment?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Judge laughed outright. &quot;You are too sharp
for me, Kitty; or Brother Mallow is too impatient
for diplomatic procedure. Well! nothing of any consequence,
my dear; we gather that your last trip was
rather speedy, and that there was a little&mdash;a trifling
accident toward the end of it. We&mdash;a&mdash;passing by,
you understand&mdash;thought we would inquire&mdash;we
wanted to make sure that you were not hurt, my
dear.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wilse Wibird was hove out, they claim!&quot; Mr.
Mallow could not abide what he called &quot;snangles&quot; in
conversation. Give him a fack and he could handle
it, but he wouldn&#39;t have no snangles.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;His Ma says the hoss was runnin&#39; away; how
about it, Kitty?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page163" id="page163"></a>[pg&nbsp;163]</span>
Kitty broke into a sudden laugh; then suddenly
looked grave.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pilot never ran away in his life, Mr. Mallow! Don&#39;t
let John Tucker know that he was ever suspected of
such a thing. I was to blame, Judge. I&mdash;wanted to
get home; I cut the corner too sharp, and Wilson
rolled out, that&#39;s all! I suppose I ought to have
stopped,&quot; she added. &quot;I never thought of his being
hurt, I truly didn&#39;t. There was a nice fat drift, and
he went into it so comfortably, I thought! I do hope
he isn&#39;t hurt, Mr. Mallow!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Here Kitty looked up at the two gentlemen with
such a penitent expression that they both laughed
again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No serious injury, I gather!&quot; said Judge Peters.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hurt his pride and made his nose bleed,&quot; said Mr.
Mallow. &quot;That&#39;s all, Kitty. Don&#39;t you worry about
him!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Something in her face made him add impulsively,
&quot;Wilse hadn&#39;t been pesterin&#39; you, had he, Kitty?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Kitty turned scarlet and jumped up hastily.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, no!&quot; she said. At least she was sure Wilson
had not meant to annoy her. She was so glad he was
not hurt, and now she wanted to show the Judge
her Dutch bulbs. He knew all about bulbs, and she
thought some of them looked queer.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Blubs, eh? Good business!&quot; Mr. Mallow rose
also. &quot;While you&#39;re showin&#39; him the blubs, I&#39;ll step
into the kitchen if you&#39;ve no projection, Kitty, and
ask S&#39;repty for her receipt for them marracoons of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page164" id="page164"></a>[pg&nbsp;164]</span>
hers. She promised it to me. Talk of Dutch, they
beat any Dutch ever I see!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The bulbs pronounced upon, and Mr. Mallow lingering
in fervent consultation over the &quot;marracoons,&quot;
the Judge inquired for Miss Johanna. He trusted
she was gaining steadily. It was hard for so active
a person to be deprived of liberty of locomotion even
for a time. Was she&mdash;a&mdash;interested in the bulbs?
Fond of flowers, perhaps?</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, yes, indeed, Judge! She enjoys them as much
as I do. I take every pot up to her room as soon as
it begins to bud. She isn&#39;t really ill, you know, just
tired and resting. Speaking of flowers, do you know,
some unknown friend sends her the most wonderful
violets, every week! They scent the whole house!
Don&#39;t you smell them, Judge Peters?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Judge sniffed gravely and thought he did perceive
a fragrance: highly agreeable. Miss Ross was
fond of violets?</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They are her favorite flowers; and just think,&quot;
Kitty rippled on, &quot;they have come to her every week
for twenty years, and she has <i>never</i> known who sent
them. Did you ever hear of anything so romantic?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Quite so!&quot; the Judge rose and looked about for
his hat. &quot;Very pleasant, very agreeable. Probably
the sender enjoys the blossoms fully as much as the
recipient. Present my kindest regards to your aunt,
will you, Kitty? Tell her I trust it will not be long
before her old friends may enjoy the privilege of her
society. Ahem! Brother Mallow, we should be stepping.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page165" id="page165"></a>[pg&nbsp;165]</span>
Good-bye, my dear! Happy to find you so
well!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Going down the hill, the two gentlemen came to a
conclusion which was less than just to the unfortunate
Wilson. He was not drunk, only slightly &quot;elevated,&quot;
to use an obsolescent slang phrase. But Mr.
Mallow knew his nephew well, and if there was a
doubt, Wilson received no benefit of it. Wilson had
been drunk, they decided, and had annoyed Kitty, who
had &quot;speeded up&quot; the only-too-ready Pilot in order
to escape his importunities. Young cub had ought
to be horsewhipped, Mr. Mallow thought; the Judge
urged a severe reprimand instead. Kitty must be kept
out of this so far as might be, he said. A different
impression must be created from either of the two
which had been&mdash;unfortunately&mdash;put about early in
the day. Yes! highly injudicious.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pair o&#39; darned patterin&#39; chetticoats!&quot; interjected
Mr. Mallow, and neither he nor the Judge noticed the
transposition of consonants.</p>

<p class="indent">Gravely consulting, the two gentlemen repaired to
the office of the <i>Centinel</i>, where &quot;Italio&quot; had already
begun a fervid eulogy of the Party. As a result,
the following paragraph appeared next morning in
the paper:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Among those who ministered to the enjoyment of
Cyrus in connection with the delightful festivity of
last evening, not least was our talented and accomplished
young equestrienne, Miss Katharine Ross, who
with the valuable assistance of Mr. John Tucker transported
all the guests to and from the ball with equal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page166" id="page166"></a>[pg&nbsp;166]</span>
skill and celerity. The gallant steeds which Mr. Tucker
keeps in such prime condition partook of the gayety
of the occasion, and doubtless in their equine fashion
enjoyed the evening as much as the fortunate bipeds
whom they furnished with the means of speedy locomotion.
The Scribe is informed that an unexpected
burst of playful speed on the part of the justly-celebrated
black thoroughbred, Pilot, was the cause of
one of our young gallants&#39; receiving a morning bath
of snow earlier than his accustomed hour. Hard luck,
Wilson! Italio is glad you got off with a nosebleed!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">So Pilot had to bear the blame after all, and John
Tucker was furious.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Wibird and Melissa had a hard time of it
for the next few days. No part of Wilson&#39;s
bodily frame had been hurt, except his nose,
which had encountered something hard and was swollen
to the size and shape of a potato; but his feelings in
general and his pride in particular had suffered grievous
injury. After one glance in the mirror, the morning
after the party, he fled back to his bed, and remained
there for some hours; but his room was cold,
and by afternoon he was downstairs in the sitting-room,
with his back to the light, and his feet on the
baseburner stove. No one was to be let in, he informed
his mother peremptorily. He wouldn&#39;t be seen
by any one, a sight like this. Mrs. Wibird, suggesting
a flaxseed poultice, was waved away angrily. All he
asked, he announced, was to be left alone. This meant
that his mother must sit either in the kitchen or in a
cold bedroom: she chose the former alternative, and
repaired thither meekly with her sewing, leaving her
son to nurse his injuries in solitude.</p>

<p class="indent">His nose! if it had been anything else! A gash
on the brow, or a cut on the cheek, which might look,
when healed, like a Scar of Battle: either of them
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page168" id="page168"></a>[pg&nbsp;168]</span>
might have been displayed with equanimity, even with
pride; might be accounted for in a dozen ways. But
a swollen and crimson nose! Wilson groaned and
clenched his teeth. He was proud of his nose, which
was of the beak variety: he called it his commanding
feature. He often, in fancy, read descriptions of his
appearance in the leading journals of the country.
&quot;A glance at this eminent man shows a commanding
nose and an indomitable chin.&quot; All great men had
large noses; his nose was large; the conclusion was
not far to seek.</p>

<p class="indent">As a matter of fact, Wilson Wibird was a degenerate
shoot from a stock once good. In Colonial days
the Wibirds had been prominent among public-spirited
citizens; had fought at Bunker Hill, valiantly enough;
had held responsible positions, and been commemorated
in sounding epitaphs. Little by little the race
had dwindled, peaked and pined to its present state.
Wilson&#39;s father had been postmaster, a meek, sandy
little man whom everybody liked and was sorry for,
because he had no &quot;faculty.&quot; In the son, Nature had
played one of her freaks, endowing him with the
ambitions (and the features, if you will! it certainly
was a good big nose, and his chin was, as Mr. Mallow
said, as stubborn as a mule&#39;s jaw!) of a Tamburlane,
and the abilities of a grocer&#39;s clerk in a very small
way. The ability of a hotel clerk he did not possess,
in Mr. Mallow&#39;s opinion.</p>

<p class="indent">Deeply as he felt the injury to his commanding
feature, deeper injuries still rankled in Wilson&#39;s
breast. He knew perfectly well that Kitty had tipped
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page169" id="page169"></a>[pg&nbsp;169]</span>
him out on purpose. He resented it bitterly. Some
twisted fibre of his once hard-bitted race was in him,
making him cling like a limpet to any idea he once
took up. Instead of relinquishing his quest, he was
all the more intent upon it. He would show the proud
girl what it meant to spurn a Wibird. She should be
his none the less, but he would subdue her will to his.
She should fly to him like a fondling bird, fawn upon
him like a spaniel. Once humbled, he would take her
to his heart, would raise her to his side. &quot;Ha!&quot; he
would say. Wilson loved to say, &quot;Ha!&quot; &quot;You sought
to escape me, little one! You fluttered in the net, you
pecked at the strong hand that held you; but all the
time your fate was here, your fate was here, where it
has always been!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Wilson had recently read &quot;Lorna Doone,&quot; and been
much struck by some of Carver Doone&#39;s expressions.</p>

<p class="indent">The day passed heavily for both mother and son.
Toward evening, Melissa entered, fresh from the Library.
She had had a happy day; all the girls had
been in, and they had talked over the party to their
hearts&#39; content. Everybody told Melissa how well
she looked, and how pretty her dress was. When
Nelly Chanter added that Bobby had said she looked
&quot;out of sight,&quot; Melissa&#39;s little cup overflowed, and
she&mdash;hush! never let it be told&mdash;but Nelly took out a
new book before it had been listed! Melissa being
as a rule a most conscientious little soul, and moreover
a librarian &quot;not trained, but gifted,&quot; this action
was eloquent, if unjustifiable. She came home full
of compassion for Wilson, and with a bag of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page170" id="page170"></a>[pg&nbsp;170]</span>
cinnamon buns he specially liked, to &quot;liven up&quot; his
supper.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Poor Wilson!&quot; she said, &quot;how is your poor nose?
Have you had a tiresome day? I brought you the
second volume of &#39;The Maid of Sker.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Wilson growled something unintelligible and
hunched his shoulders over the stove.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My! it&#39;s stuffy here!&quot; Melissa went on. &quot;Shan&#39;t
I open the window for a minute? It&#39;s real warm
out!&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You shall not! If you find the room stuffy, you
needn&#39;t stay in it. It does seem as if a man might
have a little peace in his own house. Shut the door,
will you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Melissa retired to the kitchen; her mother looked
up anxiously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How does he seem, Lissy? I haven&#39;t been in. I
thought he might be asleep.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He&#39;s awful cross!&quot; pouted Lissy. &quot;Snapped me
up like I was a bone!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I expect he&#39;s feeling mean!&quot; Mrs. Wibird spoke
depreciatingly. &quot;His nose must be dreadful sore; and
his feelings&mdash;he is so sensitive! I do think Kitty Ross
ought to be had up for driving that way!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, mother! Don&#39;t you say a word against
Kitty! Wilson oughtn&#39;t to have asked her to bring
him home, tired as she was, and after midnight, too.
He ought to have walked, as the other boys did. I
hear Bobby Chanter said&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Here the door opened, and Wilson appeared, his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page171" id="page171"></a>[pg&nbsp;171]</span>
small eyes glaring fiercely, though inadequately, over
his crimson potato-nose.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am going to bed!&quot; he announced. &quot;My head
aches, and this chattering drives me distracted.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So do, dear!&quot; his mother soothed him. &quot;So do!
I&#39;ll light the oil stove, and bring your supper up to
you soon as it&#39;s ready.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I brought you some cinnamon buns, Wilson!&quot; said
Melissa, who could not harbor irritation more than
two minutes. &quot;I hope your head&#39;ll be better in the
morning, dear!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Wilson flung away with no other answer than a
snarl. He ate the buns, though, when they came
up hot in a napkin; made a very good supper on the
whole. The tray disposed of, he locked his door, and
then proceeded to unlock a cupboard and take out a
bottle and glass. Poor Wilson! we liked to think it
was not his fault entirely, that some of his ancestors
had been hard drinking as well as hard-bitted; but that
made it no easier for Mrs. Wibird and Melissa.</p>

<p class="indent">When putting back the bottle and glass, his hand
touched something else in the cupboard, something
hard and smooth and cold. He muttered under his
breath; groped for the object, and brought it out. A
pistol! not of the newest make or deadliest calibre,
but still a practical weapon, capable of being loaded
and fired. Wilson&#39;s face cleared as he looked at it.
Here was a friend for a desperate man! He nodded
darkly several times; stepped to the mirror to see how
he looked when performing this act, but recoiled with
a groan. He should, properly speaking, have thrust
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page172" id="page172"></a>[pg&nbsp;172]</span>
the pistol in his bosom, but pajamas have no bosoms:
besides, the steel was cold. Finally, he put it under
his pillow, and went to sleep to the tune of murder,
suicide, and three columns in the City newspaper.</p>

<p class="indent">Youth and sleep can do much, even for the foolish
and befuddled. By morning Wilson was once more
the master of Ross House, waving in his guests (and
Kitty&#39;s) with courtly gesture. He was roused from
this happy dream by the untimely entrance of Billy,
the clerk of the Mallow House. Billy had just looked
in on his way down town, at 6:45, to find Melissa
preparing breakfast, Wilson in bed, and likely to remain
there. Billy guessed he would go up and say
howdy. Melissa protested: Billy grinned cheerfully,
and went up.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Morn&#39;n, Wilse! h&#39;are&#39;y?&quot; (I find the last word
cannot be spelled. It is chiefly H and broad A, but
the other letters are there, somehow.) Wilson
grunted and turned a striped shoulder pointedly on
the intruder.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Better get up!&quot; said Billy amicably. &quot;Better come
down!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I can&#39;t! I&#39;m sick! Can&#39;t you see I&#39;m sick? Get
out, Billy!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Can&#39;t see anything but your pyjammer shirt,&quot; said
Billy. &quot;Better get up; better come down. Boss told
me to fetch you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Wilson expressed his opinion of the Boss and of
Billy, too, in no flattering terms.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Better get up! better come down!&quot; Billy chanted
monotonously. &quot;Lose your job if you don&#39;t. Boss
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page173" id="page173"></a>[pg&nbsp;173]</span>
says he&#39;s most as sick of you as he wants to be: Jim
Shute&#39;s been seekin&#39; round for the job the past month.
Better get up! here&#39;s your pants! better come down!
here&#39;s your shirt! I&#39;ll wait downstairs.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It was thus that Billy won his battles; he never lost
one. Everybody did what Billy told him to. Nobody
could analyze his power; Mr. Mallow opined that it
was because he didn&#39;t open his head except when
there was something doin&#39;. &quot;His gun&#39;s always lo&#39;ded,
but he don&#39;t pull it more&#39;n once or twice a year.&quot; I
think it was really because of his ignoring opposition.
He never seemed to hear anything that was said on the
other side; he simply went ahead and did what he had
to do. Destiny in checks, Kitty called him. His weakness
seemed to be for the largest and loudest checks
imaginable, especially in his trousers. I always fancied
he was in love with Melissa, but&mdash;well, no matter!</p>

<p class="indent">I feel as if I ought to pause here to apologize for
this utterly one-sided story, with hardly a sound,
much less a sight of the hero. Of course every reader
who knows anything at all knows that Tom Lee is
neither dead nor false, and that he is bound to appear
at some point. But Cyrus could not know this; even
Kitty could not be sure of it, at least not always, when
she was tired. So far as I can make out, Tom at
about this time, the time of Madam Flynt&#39;s party, was
taking leave of the Emperor of China (there were
emperors in those days) and receiving from certain
officers of that potentate large sums of gold. Filling
his pockets with a small proportion of this gold, Tom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page174" id="page174"></a>[pg&nbsp;174]</span>
strolled happily through the streets of Peking, looking
in at all the bazaars, and buying everything he
thought Kitty might like. Oh! the pale green kimono
with the gold dragons! ah! the rose-colored crape
showered over with cherry blossoms! How Cyrus
was to sigh and clasp its hands over them! And the
<i>parure</i> of moonstones and aquamarines, which only
a princess or Kitty in her bloom could possibly wear!
And then, if that boy did not think of everybody in
Cyrus, or almost everybody! and buy pink coral for
Miss Egeria and red coral for Miss Almeria (coral
was &quot;in&quot; then!) and tortoise-shell for Sarepta, and
ebony and sandalwood boxes for all the rest of us, till
his trunks could hold no more! Then he sat down
and wrote to Kitty out of his faithful heart; saying
it was a dog&#39;s age since he had heard from her, but
the mails were rum in these parts, too rum for him,
so he was coming home, coming for keeps. This had
been a big job, and he had got big pay for it. In
fact, he had made his pile, Kitty: not that he would
ever stop working, she wouldn&#39;t have anything to say
to him if he did that; but he meant to settle down and
take expert jobs as they came along. They wanted
him in &mdash;&mdash;, but he would rather live in dear old
Cyrus, if Kitty was agreeable, and he fancied she
would be. If the dear Lady wanted them to live with
her, that would suit him all right; (alas! he did not
know!) he loved her dearly, and he loved every nail
in Ross House, Kitty knew that. If not, his own
house was only let from year to year, and they would
move right into that.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page175" id="page175"></a>[pg&nbsp;175]</span>
&quot;Kitty, you see I am taking it for granted that you
have waited for me. What should I do if&mdash;but I
<i>know</i> you have! that is, I know it almost always, except
when I&#39;m dog-tired or the grub has given out.
Once or twice, up in the mountains, I got a bit down,
but it never lasted. Because, of course, you know how
every hour and every minute I am thinking of you,
my darling. You must have felt it, Kitty, even when
you didn&#39;t get my letters, and I&#39;m afraid they didn&#39;t
always get through, but I hope so. You must have
realized that it has been you, standing right beside
me, going with me through everything, that has carried
me over the rough places; and there have been
some pretty rough ones, darling, but all that is over
now, and in about two weeks I shall be sailing for
home, the happiest man in the wide world, for you
are at the other end, waiting for me&mdash;aren&#39;t you,
Kitty?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Kitty got that letter. It arrived about a month
after another arrival, to be chronicled in due time.</p>

<p class="indent">Meantime the days came and went, and it was now
late April. Not yet quite spring with us, but so near
that one could hear her whispering over the hill-tops.
Mother Earth was making ready to receive her. There
was a vast deal of house-cleaning going on. Great
rains sluiced out the roads, and filled the streams to
overflowing; they rushed along, brown and foaming,
carrying with them the unsightly leavings of winter,
who had hurried off, as usual, without &quot;redding up&quot;
in any way. The river flowed broad and swift, dotted
with floating ice-cakes; the willows along the bank
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page176" id="page176"></a>[pg&nbsp;176]</span>
showed brown smoke touched with green. Here and
there were bushes with blood-red stems, vivid as
coral. In the woods, snow lingered in blackish
patches; almost touching these patches, ferns were
unrolling, hepaticas taking off their gray furs, bloodroot
opening its lovely white cups.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And oh!&quot; cried Kitty. &quot;Don&#39;t speak to me, any
one! I believe it&#39;s an anemone!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Kitty was having a holiday. Madam Flynt was
not going out that afternoon; John Tucker would
never let her, Kitty, meet the trains; Aunt Johanna
had pronounced her pale, and bidden her walk five
miles and bring back a color. She had meant to be
back in time for one o&#39;clock dinner, but as she came
downstairs Sarepta appeared with a neat tin box and
the announcement, &quot;Here&#39;s a snack! You can have
your dinner with your supper!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She vanished. Kitty peeped, saw chicken sandwiches
and an apple turnover, and departed joyful.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dear Sarepta,&quot; she murmured. &quot;If one must have
a tyrant, how nice to have one who can make turnovers!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It was a day of days. Not warm; one was not
ready for warmth yet; but every breath was a delight,
the air so tingled with wakening life. Kitty
walked not five miles, but ten, if she had known it.
She took no count of miles, swinging along over hill
and dale, her quick eyes taking in every sign of
promise; here a catkin waving, there a little host of
green spears pushing up through the brown earth.
She sat on a huge silvered root in a stump fence to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page177" id="page177"></a>[pg&nbsp;177]</span>
eat her luncheon. A chipmunk came to make inquiries
and received crumbs; a bluebird sang in a cherry tree
near by. It was a delightful feast. This was on top
of the Great Hill, from which one saw all the kingdoms
of the earth, more or less. Kitty saw and rejoiced
in all: the kingdom of pines, stretching dark
and velvety along its waving miles; the kingdom of
hills, bare and ruddy in the sunlight; the kingdom of
streams and ponds, a great necklace of sapphires
flung across the countryside. Kitty saw, and sighed
with delight; then slipped her empty box in her pocket
and set her face homeward. Already the sunbeams
came slanting through the pines on the crest; she had
a long way to go. &quot;And I must and will go back
through Lancaston Woods!&quot; said Kitty. &quot;Perhaps
I&#39;ll make a call on Savory Bite; similarly, perhaps I
won&#39;t. I wonder if his paint is blue still. Naughty
Tom!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Down the hillside went Kitty, across lots;
through steep pastures of slippery russet grass, where
the huddled rocks looked like flocks of gray sheep,
browsing; through hanging copses, the outlying pickets
of the kingdom of pines; so down at last to the
kingdom itself, the long stretch of woodland, bordered
on one side by the river, on the other by that
shy, pleasant thoroughfare known as Lancaston Road.
It was near the edge of the road that Kitty was wandering
happily along, about five o&#39;clock, when she
should have been nearer home; it was here that she
found the first anemone. She was bending over it in
rapture, when she heard a name pronounced; not her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page178" id="page178"></a>[pg&nbsp;178]</span>
own name, but a perversion of it to which she was now
only too well accustomed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Katrine!&quot; cried Wilson Wibird. &quot;Can it be? Fate
is kind for once!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Wilson had been to Tinkham: I fear on no profitable
errand. He was on his homeward way, walking with
a rather uncertain step, wavering from side to side of
the road. Catching sight of a figure through the trees,
his half-tipsy fancy prompted him to see who it was.
Here he was now, balancing himself on unsteady feet,
leering at Kitty in a way which he felt to be irresistible.
Wilson&#39;s nose had long since resumed its
normal appearance. He had by a happy inspiration
put on his good suit; a necktie of undeniable brilliancy
flaunted beneath the high collar which partly sheltered
his long bird-like neck. He felt that the occasion
was a fortunate one.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well met by sunlight, proud Titania!&quot; was his
greeting to Kitty.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How d&#39;ye do, Wilson!&quot; Kitty nodded, and stepped
past him toward the open: he, however, stepped with
her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t hurry, Katrine! it is a sweet evening: let us
stroll home together! Fate has not lightly brought
about this meeting.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I haven&#39;t time to stroll, Wilson! I must walk fast.
Don&#39;t let me hurry you, though! Good evening!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She stepped aside to pass him, but again he stepped
with her; tried for a space to keep pace with her, and
finding this difficult, planted himself squarely in front
of her.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page179" id="page179"></a>[pg&nbsp;179]</span>
&quot;Not so fast, sweet one!&quot; he said. &quot;I have a word
to say to thee. We have not met since the dance, Katrine.
A long month ago!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I believe not!&quot; Kitty spoke coolly, but she gave a
quick glance up and down the road. No one was in
sight: there was no house near except Savory Bite&#39;s
cottage, and that was out of sight round the next
corner.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Katrine was cruel that night!&quot; Wilson went on,
still balancing himself from side to side. He could
not seem to stand still and straight at the same time.
&quot;Katrine was cruel indeed. She flung her Fate from
her; tipped me out in the snow, didn&#39;t she? But her
Fate came back.&quot; He laughed. &quot;Here&#39;s Fate, Katrine!
Can&#39;t escape it; here is Fate! Fate is here!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He tapped himself on the breast, and assumed an
attitude of command.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What <i>are</i> you talking about, Wilson?&quot; exclaimed
Kitty impatiently. &quot;Please let me pass, and don&#39;t be
silly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Silly! she calls me silly!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Wilson nodded thrice solemnly and tried to take
Kitty&#39;s hand; failing in which, he waved his own and
then leveled a wavering forefinger at her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Katrine, it is time we came to an unshand&mdash;undershand&mdash;understanding!
I feel&mdash;I have long felt&mdash;that
we were born for each other. Why blink the
fact?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">This struck Wilson as a strong expression; he repeated
it&mdash;&quot;Why blink the fact! Let us hail it, joyfully,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page180" id="page180"></a>[pg&nbsp;180]</span>
Katrine. Two hearts that beat as one! You
are mine, little bird: mine!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Now, however much Wilson Wibird might indulge
in remarks of this kind to his crony, the mirror, he
would not have dared to make them to Kitty when
sober, and Kitty knew it. After that swift glance up
and down the road, she drew out a long steel hatpin
and held it in her hand.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wilson,&quot; she said briefly, &quot;what do you mean?
What are you talking about, and what do you want?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Want&mdash;you!&quot; Wilson opened his arms with a dramatic
gesture. &quot;You are mine, I say! I have an iron
will, Katrine, and that will claims you. Come, little
bird! Let us seal our union with a k&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;If you come one step nearer,&quot; said Kitty quietly,
&quot;I&#39;ll run this pin into you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She displayed the pin, really a formidable weapon.</p>

<p class="indent">Wilson, who had taken a step forward, paused.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I have an iron will!&quot; he protested. &quot;&#39;Wibird
hath iron will;&#39; did you never hear that, Katrine?
&#39;Tis the motto of our House. I am the tenth and
perhaps the last Wilson Wimberley Wibird. In me
meet the features&mdash;&quot; he indicated his nose and chin&mdash;&quot;and
the forces of my ancestors. Don&#39;t be obstinate,
Katrine!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Here his mood changed suddenly; his eyes filled
with tears.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t be cruel, Kitty!&quot; he implored. &quot;You&#39;ve always
been cruel, Kitty, and I&#39;ve always loved you.
Don&#39;t be cruel to the tenth and perhaps the last Wilson
Wimberley Wibird! Be kind, not cruel! They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page181" id="page181"></a>[pg&nbsp;181]</span>
both begin with&mdash;at least the sound is the same. I am
your Fate, Kitty&mdash;I mean Katrine! I should think
you would be kind to your Fate.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Here the gentleman wept bitterly.</p>

<p class="indent">Kitty spoke kindly and distinctly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I would go home now, Wilson, if I were you!&quot;
she said. &quot;You are not yourself. Forget this foolishness,
and go home to your mother. If you will
walk ahead, I will follow you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But Wilson&#39;s mood changed again. &quot;Never!&quot; he
said. &quot;I am desh&mdash;desperate! deshperate man! If
you won&#39;t be mine, I won&#39;t be&mdash;I mean, I&#39;ll put an
end to myself! Blow my brains out, here&#39;s minute.
Then you&#39;ll know what it is to spurn a Wibird! ha!
You mock me!&quot; He pulled out the pistol and flourished
it in the air.</p>

<p class="indent">Kitty stepped quickly forward and took it from
him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now,&quot; she said quietly, &quot;if you will walk ahead,
Wilson, I will follow you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">While these things were going on, Mr. Very Jordano
had been making his annual call on Avery Bright,
the hermit. This call was made at no regular time or
season. When news was scarce, or the pulse of
Cyrus seemed to beat feebly, the editor of the <i>Centinel</i>
was wont to cast about him for legitimate subjects of
possible interest from which a &quot;story&quot; might be extracted.
His native delicacy being perpetually at war
with his professional instinct, he could not bring himself
to take advantage of any occurrence the mention
of which might cause any &quot;feeling&quot; in any quarter of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page182" id="page182"></a>[pg&nbsp;182]</span>
the neighborhood. This warfare hampered him sadly.
But &quot;Savory Bite&quot; never read a newspaper; he had
no relations; there seemed no reason why he should
not be exploited, if only he could be brought to unfold
his tale. He never yet had unfolded his tale, but
hope sprang eternal in Mr. Jordano&#39;s breast, and once
a year, as I say, he would try his fortune. His zealous
questions were met alternately by &quot;Yep&quot; and
&quot;Nope,&quot; with &quot;I d&#39;no!&quot; as an occasional variant. As
a matter of fact, Savory had no tale to unfold. He
was not in any way an interesting or mysterious person,
save to the young or the newcomer in Cyrus. The
elders knew that he lived alone merely because his
parents had died and left him so. There he was, and
there he stayed. He had lost the habit of talking after
twenty years of a stone-deaf mother; also, he had
nothing special to say. So much for our hermit!</p>

<p class="indent">On this occasion Mr. Jordano was in great need of
a &quot;story&quot; to fill a certain column for this week&#39;s <i>Centinel</i>,
already half set up. There had been no arrivals
in Cyrus since the last issue; people had not begun to
shingle their barns or plant their gardens: it was a
dry time for editors. His success with Mr. Bright
had been no more marked than usual, but as he left
the house he was already composing a paragraph
which could not, he modestly thought, fail to interest
the public.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The Scribe made a neighborly call yesterday on
our isolated but ever courteous fellow-townsman Mr.
Avery Bright, in his domicile on the Lancaston Road.
The gentle hermit received me in his commodious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page183" id="page183"></a>[pg&nbsp;183]</span>
kitchen, which he would appear to use also as a sitting
room. It is painted of a cerulean blue, and is as
tasty an apartment as any housewife could desire. Mr.
Bright is a man of few words, and may be said to
cultivate the golden flower of silence: yet Italio received
from him some valuable information, which he
feels at liberty to impart to his readers. Spring will
be late, in Mr. Bright&#39;s opinion. The breast of that
useful and (when roasted with the seasonable adjuncts
of sage, onion and applesauce) toothsome feathered
biped, the goose, which hangs beside his well-polished
stove, displays large patches of white. This
shows that the winter has been a hard one, which, indeed,
we know to have been the case: it also foretells,
the weatherwise anchorite intimated, that the spring
will be backward. On the Scribe&#39;s venturing a pleasantry
to the effect that spring, like other good things,
was worth waiting for, Mr. Bright signified his assent
to the proposition by a sagacious nod. As to the
woodchuck&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Jordano got no farther with the woodchuck.
Lifting his eyes as he closed the gate of the hermitage
behind him, he saw a sight that made him start
and almost drop his notebook. Up the road came
Wilson Wibird, plodding sullenly along with bent
head and muttering lips; behind him walked Kitty
Ross, holding a pistol in her hand. After the first
petrified glance, Mr. Jordano hastened forward, calling
Kitty&#39;s name; she and her convoy looked up at
the same moment.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Damn!&quot; said Wilson.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page184" id="page184"></a>[pg&nbsp;184]</span>
&quot;Oh, Mr. Jordano!&quot; cried Kitty. &quot;I am <i>so</i> glad
to see you! Are you&mdash;are you going my way?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Absolutely! absolutely!&quot; cried Mr. Jordano, seizing
the first word that came to his bewildered mind.
&quot;I should esteem it a high privilege, Miss Kitty. Permit
me, my&mdash;my dear young lady!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He motioned toward the pistol; Kitty gladly relinquished
it, and he drew a breath of relief.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Periloso!&quot; he murmured. &quot;Extremely periloso!
If your foot should slip-pip-pip&mdash;step out, Wilson!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">His tone changed from that of anxious courtesy to
imperious command. The unhappy Wilson, feeling
the impact of the pistol muzzle between his shoulders,
stepped out. Beginning to mutter curses, he
was sternly bidden to hold his tongue-pung-pung!
Thus they proceeded along the Lancaston Road, where
fortunately the houses are few and far between; a
tragi-comic little procession. Mr. Jordano was fairly
snorting with chivalrous indignation. His dark eyes
flashed real fire; his cloak was thrown superbly over
his shoulder. Could the dear gentleman have known
it, he really looked for the nonce like one of the
Italian patriots on whom he so desired to form himself.
Presently he became aware that Kitty was
trembling. Bending anxiously toward her, she
turned on him a face of suppressed and remorseful
laughter.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Put it away!&quot; she whispered. &quot;We are coming to
a house. He won&#39;t give any more trouble, I am sure.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Jordano nodded and slipped the pistol into his
pocket. Soon after, they came to a crossroad which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page185" id="page185"></a>[pg&nbsp;185]</span>
led by a short cut to the Common and Ross House.
Seeing Kitty about to turn aside, Mr. Jordano made
as if to accompany her, but she checked him with a
decided shake of her head. As he hesitated, she laid
her finger on her lips, kissed it toward him with an
adorable gesture of gratitude and affection, and, turning,
sped away in the gathering dusk. Mr. Jordano
looked after her with a sigh; he felt that kiss warm at
his heart. He would lay down his life, if necessary,
for that sweet young lady. Anger sweeping him again
as he turned to the shambling figure before him, he
addressed it with asperity.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come, Wilson! wake up-pup-pup! Step out-tout-tout!
You ought to be lighting the lamps this minute.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But I ask you, was it not hard that the real &quot;story&quot;
which had dropped for him out of a clear sky, as it
were, was one that Mr. Jordano&#39;s knightly soul could
not for an instant think of as matter for publication?</p>

<p class="indent">What a paragraph it would have made!</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page186" id="page186"></a>[pg&nbsp;186]</span></p>

<p class="h2">CHAPTER XIII<br />
<span class="smcap">pilot</span></p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dear Dan! but you don&#39;t think it is anything
serious, John?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, no, Miss Kitty. He&#39;ll be fit as a
fiddle in two-three days. All I mean, he give himself
a little wrinch, like, and I thought let him rest
up a day or two, that&#39;s all. Anybody has to rest
once in a while; any hoss, I would say.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well!&quot; Kitty gave Dan another lump of sugar.
&quot;I believe all he wants is more sugar, John Tucker.
Just look at him! You are an angelic humbug, Dan
dear, and you aren&#39;t to have another scrap. So&mdash;you&#39;ll
take Old Crummles to the station, I suppose,
John. And I&#39;ll take Madam Flynt with Pilot.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Kitty did not look at John Tucker as she said this;
they both looked a little conscious. Old Crummles,
the third horse, bought by John Tucker (Kitty vowed
she would never attempt another horse trade!) was
eminently safe and sound, but a trifle dull. Neither
Kitty nor John Tucker specially enjoyed driving him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, Miss!&quot; said John Tucker. &quot;Three o&#39;clock, I
suppose.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Immediately Kitty&#39;s heart began to smite her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are as angelic as Dan, John Tucker,&quot; she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page187" id="page187"></a>[pg&nbsp;187]</span>
cried. &quot;And I am a selfish Thing! and wicked, too,&quot;
she added: &quot;I know Madam Flynt is dreadfully afraid
of Pilot. She has only driven behind him once, and
then she felt that her life hung on the dasher, she
told me afterward. So I&#39;ll take Old Crummles, John
Tucker, dear.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But John Tucker was up in arms at once in defense
of his favorite.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Madam Flynt has no call to be afraid of Pilot,&quot; he
said gruffly. &quot;Pilot is as clever a hoss as is in this
State; and as stiddy, for a young hoss. What I mean,
you don&#39;t expect a young hoss to reason things out
the way an old one does. Take Dan now, or even
Crummles, though he hasn&#39;t much more sense than a
meal-tub; what I mean, you couldn&#39;t scare either one
on &#39;em; not if you said &#39;Boo!&#39; right in their count&#39;nance.
They&#39;d toss their head, at least Dan would,
and think, &#39;Well, I ain&#39;t a jackass, anyway!&#39; But
take a young, spirited hoss like Pilot, and he hasn&#39;t
had the experience, Miss Kitty, that&#39;s all there is to
it. You meet a thrashing-machine, say, with Pilot, or
an elephant, or something else that it don&#39;t <i>belong</i>
there, what I mean is. Well, he&#39;ll antic up a mite, to
express surprise, same as a person would. &#39;My land!&#39;
he says: &#39;what&#39;s that?&#39; Only he says it with his head
and his four legs, not havin&#39; language, as you may
say.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;John Tucker! you never met an elephant with
Pilot!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I did, Miss! not one, but three elephants: &#39;twas that
circus used to go through North Cyrus to the City.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page188" id="page188"></a>[pg&nbsp;188]</span>
Well! Pilot warn&#39;t only three years old then. He
co&#39;t sight of them elephants, and he was all over the
ro&#39;d, all over the lot, all over the county, in a minute,
but he never meant no harm. He was only wonderin&#39;,
that was all. No, Miss Kitty!&quot; John Tucker shut his
jack-knife with a decided snap, and turned away from
the stall.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You take Pilot for Madam Flynt. He&#39;ll do anything
in creation you tell him, and she&#39;ll have a real
nice ride. I ain&#39;t any too fond of takin&#39; him to the
trains anyway,&quot; he added. &quot;He gets real annoyed
if he has to stand round waitin&#39;, and I don&#39;t know as
I blame him.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">So at three o&#39;clock, after a confidential talk with
Pilot, in which she explained the situation to him, and
told him he was going to be just as saintly as Dan,
and not so much as wink if they met a whole caravan
of elephants (which was most unlikely at this season),
Kitty drove up to Madam Flynt&#39;s door. Pilot
stood like a rock while the two ladies got in. They
were engaged in a rather acrimonious discussion as
to the quality and thickness of an extra wrap carried
by Miss Croly, and did not notice the horse; Kitty
thought it unnecessary to call attention to him, and
off they went. The day was perfect; so was Pilot.
He settled down almost at once into the long smooth
trot that covered twelve miles an hour and seemed absolutely
effortless. &quot;I can keep this up all day,&quot; he
signified to Kitty with one ear, &quot;if this is what you
want. A trifle dull, what?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, darling!&quot; replied Kitty with the slightest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page189" id="page189"></a>[pg&nbsp;189]</span>
movement of the reins; &quot;but it is precisely right, and
you are a Cherry Pie, and shall have the most <i>delicious</i>
mash for your precious supper!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There is a State Road to South Cyrus, good even
in early spring. Pilot sped along over hill and dale,
now and then tossing his beautiful head from sheer
joy, but otherwise behaving with absolute decorum.
Madam Flynt&#39;s irritation about the cloak subsiding,
she began to enjoy herself thoroughly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How delightful the air is!&quot; she said. &quot;The tang
is really gone: I call this positively balmy. Aren&#39;t you
driving very fast, Kitty?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s just his usual gait, Madam Flynt,&quot; replied
Kitty craftily. &quot;It&#39;s partly the road. Don&#39;t you
think one always seems to be going faster on a smooth
road?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That may be so!&quot; said Madam Flynt sagaciously.
&quot;The road is certainly excellent. What are you doing,
Cornelia?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I was tucking your feet in, Clarissa. One of them
was protruding beyond the robe!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I protruded it on purpose!&quot; Madam Flynt spoke
with decision. &quot;It was too warm. They are my feet,
Cornelia: I suppose you will grant that?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Willingly, my dear Clarissa!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Seldom, almost never, did Miss Croly allow any
tinge of malice to color speech or even thought. She
knew her duty and intended to do it, but her firmness
was almost invariably gentle. This time, however,
there was the slightest suspicion of meaning in
her &quot;willingly!&quot; Her feet were her one beauty: long,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page190" id="page190"></a>[pg&nbsp;190]</span>
narrow, high of instep. Madam Flynt&#39;s were flat and
pudgy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Very well!&quot; said Madam Flynt, fully appreciating
the shade of tone. &quot;Then perhaps you will let me manage
them myself. We&#39;ll turn round at the heater piece,
Kitty, and come back over this same good road. I am
enjoying this air so! The motion is really exhilarating!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They turned at the heater piece, and Pilot&#39;s stride
quickened automatically. (Does every one know that
a heater piece is the triangular space between two
branching roads?) He was still behaving perfectly,
he assured Kitty, but it was not in nature not to go a
little faster when one&#39;s head was turned toward home
and supper. Kitty explained this to Madam Flynt,
who replied that she had never observed it before.
Dan was one of those rare horses who can resist the
call of the stable and keep the same untroubled pace
whichever way their head is turned.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Can you check the animal, my love?&quot; quavered
Miss Croly, who had been secretly alarmed all through
the drive. &quot;Nervousness is very bad for our dear
friend; it induces sleeplessness.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nothing of the sort, Cornelia Croly!&quot; Madam
Flynt became majestic. &quot;I have every confidence in
Kitty&#39;s driving, I am sure. What&mdash;what is the matter,
my dear?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Kitty had said a word and Pilot stopped suddenly,
almost too suddenly for the equilibrium of the two
passengers. They were passing the Gaylord place:
Kitty was aware of two figures standing by the gap in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page191" id="page191"></a>[pg&nbsp;191]</span>
the hedge, one of which beckoned to her: Judge Peters
and Mr. Mallow. The Judge spoke.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You, Kitty? And with Pilot? Thank God! Madam
Flynt, Miss Croly, your most obedient servant! do not
be alarmed, ladies, but this is a case of emergency.
Mr. Gaylord is here, seriously ill. Dr. Pettijohn must
come at once. Mr. Mallow was about to set out on
foot, but if you could go, Kitty?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course!&quot; cried Kitty. &quot;That is, if Madam
Flynt&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course!&quot; exclaimed Madam Flynt in turn.
&quot;Need you ask, Edward? Is he very ill?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dying, we fear!&quot; The Judge spoke low. &quot;I must
go back to him. Kitty, my child, do the best you&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Drive like <i>hemp</i>, will you, Kitty?&quot; cried Mr. Mallow,
down whose rosy cheeks the tears were streaming.
(&quot;Hemp&quot; was Mr. Mallow&#39;s strongest expression:
most people spelled it with <i>ll</i> instead of <i>mp</i>.)</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, yes! yes! <i>Drive as fast as you can</i>, Kitty!&quot;
cried Madam Flynt. Russell Gaylord had been in
her Sunday school class, and she loved him.</p>

<p class="indent">Kitty flashed a glance back.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do you mean it?&quot; she cried. &quot;You do? Oh, you
darling Thing! Sit tight, then!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She bent forward and gave a long, low, clear whistle.
It was her private signal to Pilot; it meant that
there was a stretch of good road ahead and no one in
sight to be shocked or frightened. The black horse
whinnied a response, quivered, then sprang forward
literally like an arrow from a bow. The Judge looked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page192" id="page192"></a>[pg&nbsp;192]</span>
after him as he shot down the road at a three-minute
gait. A momentary smile lightened his sad face.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Poor Madam Flynt!&quot; he said. &quot;Poor Miss Croly!
Come, Marshall!&quot; and they went back into the house.</p>

<p class="indent">Remember that for many years Madam Flynt and
her companion had been accustomed to Flanagan&#39;s
horses, whose best speed never exceeded four miles
an hour. Dan&#39;s steady eight had terrified them at
first; though they were now used to it, and felt a
certain pride in his swiftness as he trotted sturdily
along, never quickening, never slackening, his comfortable
stride. Fancy, then, their emotions when, as
Miss Croly afterward expressed it in her fervent way,
&quot;the lightning was unchained, and they flew with the
bolt of Heaven!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It was three good miles to Dr. Pettijohn&#39;s house.
Before one mile was passed, the two ladies were perfectly
sure that Kitty had lost control of the horse;
that he was <i>running away</i>! They had heard the fatal
word &quot;Pilot!&quot; Each clutched a side of the carriage
with one hand; the other clasped that of her friend.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Clarissa,&quot; murmured Miss Croly, &quot;we are together
in death as in life.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t be&mdash;oh!&quot; Madam Flynt had meant to say
&quot;absurd,&quot; but at this moment they turned off the
smooth State road into one which led directly past
Dr. Pettijohn&#39;s house. This road was an ordinary
country thoroughfare, which, in our State, in the
month of April, is not smooth.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh!&quot; cried Madam Flynt, as they encountered the
first &quot;honeypot.&quot; (A honeypot is a spot where the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page193" id="page193"></a>[pg&nbsp;193]</span>
frost, coming out of the ground, leaves behind it unplumbed
depths of liquid mud.) Down went one
wheel, up went the other.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Steady, darling!&quot; said Kitty.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Pooh!&quot; said Pilot with one ear, and was out and
away before one could say &quot;Oats,&quot; much less &quot;Jack
Robinson.&quot; Madam Flynt&#39;s bonnet was over one eye,
Miss Croly&#39;s dangled from the back of her head.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Cornelia,&quot; said Madam Flynt, &quot;I have left you an
annuity!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Clarissa!&quot; moaned Miss Croly, &quot;I have sometimes
opposed your wishes; with the best intent, but
perhaps mistakenly. Forgive me! We will die together!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;An annuity,&quot; repeated Madam Flynt; &quot;sufficient
to keep you and Sarah in the house&mdash;<i>oh!</i> as long
as you live. Abby Ann has her brother. The rest
goes to Kitty&mdash;<i>Ah!</i>&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Another &quot;honeypot.&quot; This time any one but Kitty
and Pilot would have thought they <i>must</i> go over.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is coming!&quot; gasped Miss Croly. &quot;Clarissa, <i>fall
on me</i>! My body will break the fall: you may escape&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Even in this crisis, Madam Flynt&#39;s sense of humor
did not desert her. &quot;I don&#39;t know that bones are any
better than rocks to fall on!&quot; she whispered. &quot;Hold
on tight, Cornelia! <i>hold on</i>&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But now, a miracle! They whirled round a corner,
whirled up a driveway: a touch on the reins, a word,
and Pilot stood, breathing quickly, but otherwise
statue-like, before Dr. Pettijohn&#39;s door. He had <i>not</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page194" id="page194"></a>[pg&nbsp;194]</span>
been running away! Kitty had had him in control all
the time! In one thought-flash, Miss Croly removed
Joan of Arc and Mary Stuart from their pedestals and
set up Kitty Ross as her Heroine for all time.</p>

<p class="indent">Three minutes more, and they were speeding back,
still at arrow-flight. Dr. Pettijohn knew Pilot and
Kitty, and leaned back comfortably on the front seat,
reflecting that it was criminal for such a horse as
that to be owned by any one but a doctor. Madam
Flynt resumed her dignity, and cast a quelling glance
at Miss Croly, who was now making ineffective dabs
at her patroness&#39;s bonnet with a view to straightening
it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let me alone!&quot; said the lady. &quot;I prefer it as it is.
And <i>hold on</i>, you ridiculous woman! We are going
faster than ever, even if the animal is under control.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Kitty was very sorry about poor Mr. Gaylord, but
she could not help realizing that Pilot was in wonderful
condition to-day. She quoted under her breath, for
Dr. Pettijohn&#39;s benefit:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;I would not have the horse I drive</span><br />
<span class="i2">So fast that folks should stop and stare;</span><br />
<span class="i0">An easy gait,&mdash;two-forty-five&mdash;</span><br />
<span class="i2">Suits me; I do not care.</span><br />
<span class="i0">Perhaps, <i>just for a single spurt</i>,</span><br />
<span class="i2">Some seconds less would do no hurt!&quot;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">The doctor nodded.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Trouble is, Miss Kitty, your track is too short!&quot;
he said, as the Gaylord chimneys rose above the next
turn of the road.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page195" id="page195"></a>[pg&nbsp;195]</span>
&quot;I know!&quot; Kitty nodded regretfully. &quot;He&#39;s just
got warmed up to his work, and here we are!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Here they were; turning in at the great gateway;
crunching over the gravel; stopping at the gaunt front
door, which had not been opened in twenty years. It
opened now, and Judge Peters stood on the steps.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well done, Kitty!&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;Yes, you are
in time. Come in, Dr. Pettijohn. One moment!&quot;
he bent to whisper in Kitty&#39;s ear. &quot;One more errand
for you, my dear brave child! Providence sent you
to-night, I am confident of it. Our poor friend desires
greatly to see your Aunt Johanna. Yes!&quot; as
Kitty uttered a cry of surprise. &quot;They were friends
in youth; perhaps more than friends. He wishes to
take leave of her. Is she able to come, do you think,
Kitty? Not for worlds would I have her do herself
an injury!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perfectly able, I am sure! I&#39;ll just take the ladies
home; thank you, Judge dear!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pilot did very well, Kitty thought, to slacken his
pace so cheerfully the rest of the way to Madam
Flynt&#39;s house; even so, they were two shaken and disheveled
ladies who dismounted at the stone steps,
and Abby Ann, hurrying out with the foot-stool, exclaimed
in dismay at their appearance.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;For the goodness gracious sake, Madam!&quot; she
cried. &quot;Whatever has happened to your bonnet?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Madam Flynt waved her aside with dignity and addressed
Kitty.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We have had a <i>most interesting</i> drive!&quot; she said.
&quot;I congratulate you, Kitty, on your skill; and I am
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page196" id="page196"></a>[pg&nbsp;196]</span>
deeply thankful to have been able&mdash;you understand,
my dear! Good evening! Cornelia, you are treading
on my skirt. If you <i>have</i> pretty feet, it is not necessary
to trample&mdash;&mdash;There! don&#39;t mind me! it was my
fault, I dare say.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Every moment of this evening was bitten into
Kitty&#39;s mind, an ineffaceable impression: sharpest and
clearest of all, the moment when she stood faltering in
the doorway of the Red Indian Room.</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Johanna Ross (in rose-color this time) was
sitting erect among her pillows, reading &quot;Framley Parsonage.&quot;
She was going through the whole Trollope
fleet of &quot;old three-deckers&quot; with infinite enjoyment.
Her firm, rather sharp countenance was relaxed in
lines of leisurely amusement. Looking up, and meeting
Kitty&#39;s eyes, it waked into vivid attention.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What&#39;s the matter?&quot; demanded Miss Johanna.
&quot;Sickness or accident?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She had dropped her book, and was gathering her
draperies about her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sickness!&quot; Kitty spoke quietly, trying to keep all
hurry out of her voice.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;An old friend of yours, Aunt Johanna, has come
back and is&mdash;is very ill, I fear. He would like to see
you. It is&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Russell Gaylord!&quot; said Johanna Ross.</p>

<p class="indent">The Rosses all move quickly. &quot;Medicated lightning,&quot;
people used to call Dr. Ross, when he was summoned
to an emergency case. Kitty could only think
of this, as without another word her aunt flashed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page197" id="page197"></a>[pg&nbsp;197]</span>
from her pillows, rustled into her clothes, and with a
shake of her shoulders stood alert, able, prepared.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, child!&quot; she pinned on her veil with a steady
hand. &quot;I am ready. Who sent you? Judge Peters?
Good! and you have Pilot? Good again! we need
lose no time. I dreamed last night&mdash;come!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pilot may have wondered where his promised mash
was; why he was carefully blanketed for ten minutes,
then taken out once more, and once more given the
signal for full speed; but beyond a whinny of surprise,
and a toss of his head, he gave no sign. Kitty&#39;s
word was Pilot&#39;s law. Again the miles sped by; this
time the passenger took no heed of them; the pace was
all too slow for her. Again the flying turn, the crunching
gravel; again the door opening, the grave figure
hastening down the steps.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Alive! still conscious! yes! asking for you. Thank
God you are come! The end is near, prepare for a
great change, my friend!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Shall we go in with Johanna Ross to that room
where the love of her youth lies gasping his last hour
away? Shall we look upon her, kneeling by the bedside,
holding the skeleton hands, looking tenderly into
the hollow eyes? No! we have no business there. We
will come away, with the two faithful friends, who
went, one to stand outside the chamber door, in case
of need, the other on the steps, smoothing Pilot&#39;s
glossy neck and exchanging brief snatches of talk with
Kitty; she, wondering, pitying, yet dreading to touch
upon the mystery that had outlasted her young life.</p>

<p class="indent">They were all at school together, Mr. Mallow said.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page198" id="page198"></a>[pg&nbsp;198]</span>
Russ was an elegant boy. &quot;Him and Johanna was always
together, same as you and&mdash;&mdash;&quot; Here Mr. Mallow
was seized with a prolonged fit of coughing.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Anybody ask you about Russ Gaylord,&quot; cried the
hotel keeper, &quot;and you say he was nobody&#39;s enemy but
his own. Nobody&#39;s but his own! Your father knew
that. Doctor knew it. &#39;Russ,&#39; he&#39;d say, &#39;Stop <i>now</i>!
stop to-day! <i>you can!</i>&#39; but he couldn&#39;t; he couldn&#39;t.
The peth was dead in him, like a dozy log. Yes!
Poor Russ! too bad, ain&#39;t it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Has he been ill long, Mr. Mallow?&quot; asked Kitty
timidly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He&#39;s ben ailin&#39; ever sence he come. Lemme see!
March wasn&#39;t it? Yes, March, and here we are in
May. He&#39;s ben jest wastin&#39; away, poor Russ has.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not&mdash;he hasn&#39;t been all alone, has he?&quot; with a
glance at the dark, shuttered house, the tall firs pointing
spectral fingers at it, and the great chestnut tree,
tossing its bare arms as if in grief or horror.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Me and Ned&mdash;I would say the Jedge&mdash;has ben
here all we could. He wouldn&#39;t have no one else!
We was boon companions in primary school, and we
kep&#39; right on. Not in all ways, is what I would say;
there was p&#39;ints&mdash;no need to go into that! His heart
was right in his boosum all the time, Russ&#39;s was. Now
he lays there.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Mallow drew out his handkerchief and wiped
his eyes simply.</p>

<p class="indent">All Cyrus came to Russell Gaylord&#39;s funeral. Tinkham,
too, and Tupham. Some, no doubt, came from curiosity,
idle or worse, to see the great house open
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page199" id="page199"></a>[pg&nbsp;199]</span>
once more, the long windows thrown wide, the sunlight
gilding the mouldered furniture and moth-eaten
tapestries. These would be outsiders. Cyrus people
were full of sorrow and compassion. They came in
their best clothes, Madam Flynt in her ermine and
velvet, Anne Peace in her brown Sunday gown; it
was all they could do. With bowed heads they entered
the door. How jovially the gay young host
used to welcome them to these long drawing-rooms!
How shining and scented they used to be, with lights
and flowers! There were flowers now. Kitty and
Nelly Chanter had found enough early blossoms in
the neglected garden to make a wreath&mdash;only Forsythia
and Japanese pear, but it was gay and cheerful&mdash;and
some one had sent a splendid wreath of passion
flowers. At the last Johanna Ross, who stood at the
head of the coffin, while Mr. Chanter read the service,
took the bunch of violets from her bosom, and laid
it over the dead man&#39;s heart.</p>

<p class="h2">CHAPTER XIV<br />
<span class="smcap">johanna rediviva</span></p>

<p class="indent">Miss Johanna did not go back to bed. She
had had six months of rest, she said, and that
was enough.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Besides,&quot; she added, &quot;I must show myself for poor
Russell&#39;s sake. I can&#39;t have people saying that he
ruined my health for life, as well as destroyed my
reason.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She spoke frankly to Kitty, as they sat together on
the leather sofa, the evening after the funeral.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That was why I went away!&quot; said Miss Johanna.
&quot;We were very much in love with each other, but it
was no use. He couldn&#39;t keep straight; and I am
not a fool, Kitty. He wouldn&#39;t give me up, so I went
away. Wrongly, your little mother thought; John
knew I was right. So there is all about that!&quot; Thus
Miss Johanna, very erect on the sofa. Kitty, moving
close beside her, put her arm round her and laid her
fair head against her shoulder.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thank you, my dear! yes, it was hard; almost as
hard to have Mary disapprove of me as to lose him.&quot;
Miss Johanna brushed away a tear, and frowned at
the spot on her handkerchief.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She asked me&mdash;little romantic goose of a white
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page201" id="page201"></a>[pg&nbsp;201]</span>
rose!&mdash;if I thought she would leave John if <i>he</i>&mdash;&mdash;&#39;My
child,&#39; I said, &#39;John would leave you! John
would allow nothing of that kind to come within sight
or sound of you. If he found he <i>had</i> to drink, he
would go and drink in the Mammoth Cave, and drop
the bottles into the bottomless pit.&#39; It was true!</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But mind you, Kitty!&quot; Miss Johanna spoke incisively,
after a silence, during which both had gazed
into the fire with tear-bright eyes. &quot;You must not
think I have mourned for twenty years. People don&#39;t
do that, not even women. I mourned for a good while,
as long as was reasonable; perhaps longer. Otherwise,
I have been a busy and on the whole a contented
woman. Why shouldn&#39;t I be? I have friends all over
the country; I have had many pleasures; now, thanks
to you, my dear child, I have a home, the home of my
own childhood. Considering humanity in the aggregate,
I have done extremely well. Extremely well!
A single woman can be happy enough, Kitty,&quot; Miss
Johanna did not look at her niece as she spoke, &quot;happy
enough if she has <i>sense</i>. I have known spinsters who
had twice as many children as if they had borne &#39;em;
and I&#39;ve known mothers, dozens of &#39;em, with hearts
and arms as empty as their heads. And if Sarepta
Darwin wants anything,&quot; added Miss Johanna, &quot;I&#39;ll
thank her to put a name to it, instead of clucking and
scuttling out there in the hall.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Sarepta appeared, and fixed the speaker with a
wintry eye. &quot;<i>I</i> don&#39;t want anything!&quot; she said austerely.
&quot;I was comin&#39; to ask whether <i>you</i> wanted
any supper; that&#39;s all. Bell rang ten minutes ago;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page202" id="page202"></a>[pg&nbsp;202]</span>
don&#39;t make no odds to me whether it&#39;s hot or cold.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It did make odds to Miss Johanna, however, that
Sarepta had prepared for supper all her little favorite
delicacies, down to the dash of cinnamon on the buttered
toast, with which she usually &quot;couldn&#39;t bother.&quot;
Late that evening, when Kitty was in bed, the stately
lady crept down the back stairs to the kitchen, and
had a comfortable little cry with her old grammar-school
mate, who in her grim fashion had worshiped
Russell Gaylord ever since, at the age of twelve, he
gave her a bite of his apple.</p>

<p class="indent">The next thing, Miss Johanna announced, was the
Visits. People had left cards for her when she came:
sympathetic cards, inquisitive cards, scandalized cards,
as the case might be. Now, for the sake of things in
general (and Kitty in particular, it may be confessed
between author and reader), Miss Johanna determined
to &quot;make her manners,&quot; and prove her sanity
of mind and body. These were exciting days for Cyrus.
One hardly dared leave the house for fear of
missing The Call.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Has she been to see you? She has? Well! how
did she appear? Was she flighty, or what you would
call reasonable? Stylish? Well, you would expect
that! she was always one to dress. What did she&mdash;&mdash;oh!
broadcloth! Well! that is always ladylike. They
claim basket-weaves are all the style now, but I don&#39;t
know. Anyhow, it&#39;s something for her to be in her
right mind.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Wibird was openly disturbed about the influence
that Johanna was likely to exert over Kitty.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page203" id="page203"></a>[pg&nbsp;203]</span>
&quot;While she was in her bed,&quot; said the lady, &quot;it was
another matter; but now, the two of them together,
and like that, it&#39;s my <i>fear</i> we shall see things that we
are not used to them in Cyrus.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Melissa was on fire instantly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t know what you mean, Mother! What kind
of things?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, you don&#39;t know, my child;&quot; Mrs. Wibird shook
a melancholy head over the bowl in which she was mixing
gingerbread. &quot;You don&#39;t know, and it is far from
my wish that you should.&quot; (N. B. The good lady
had no idea herself what she meant, but Lissy
shouldn&#39;t speak back like that.) &quot;I say nothing;
nothing at all! I never do say anything, as is well
known. But take the way Kitty Ross drives, which is
in itself a scandal, be the other who it may; and add to
it a person who has <i>always</i> been peculiar, and now
little better than a lunatic, if all one hears&mdash;hand me
the spice-box, will you, Lissy? You&#39;ve kned that dough
enough; you&#39;ll take the courage all out of it&mdash;all I
say is, I <i>hope</i> Cyrus will not rue the day that either
one of them&mdash;My <i>gracious</i>, Lissy! they&#39;re driving up
to the door this minute! Here, take my apron! No!
You go to the door&mdash;no, I&#39;ll go to the door and keep
&#39;em back while you pull up the parlor curt&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Johanna</i> Ross! do not tell me this is you! well!
well! well! you <i>are</i> a stranger! Kitty comin&#39; in? No!
the wild animal wouldn&#39;t stand, of course. Terrible!&quot;
as Kitty and Pilot whisked round the corner. &quot;I expect
to see her dashed in fragments any day: <i>any</i> day!
My son Wilson nearly met his death the night of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page204" id="page204"></a>[pg&nbsp;204]</span>
Madam Flynt&#39;s party. Well, if this isn&#39;t a sight for
sore eyes. Come in! Come <i>right</i> in, Johanna! I
never thought to be welcoming you into my humble
sitting-room in <i>this</i> world!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The Misses Bygood had made fitting preparations
to receive their old friend and schoolmate. The covers
were taken off Aunt Messenger&#39;s Chair (embroidered
by that lady seventy-five years ago, and as fresh as
the day it was finished, owing to the covers; there
were three, one basted, one tied, and the third but-
toned on); the tidies and the frilled tassel-bags were
done up&mdash;I met some one the other day who had never
heard of a tassel-bag!&mdash;an extra touch given to the
shining silver and crystal. And after all this, Miss
Johanna made her call in the shop! One might have
known she would! Miss Almeria reflected; there was
a shade of austerity on her smooth brow as she advanced
to greet her guest. Miss Johanna was buoyant.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Howdy? howdy?&quot; she cried. &quot;Second call, you
see, Almy! First call on Madam Flynt, second on
Miss Bygoods: Proprieties of Cyrus, volume <span class="smcap">I</span>, chapter
<span class="smcap">I</span>. Father down yet?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Father not down; it was early for him. Egeria
usually brought him down at ten o&#39;clock. It was now
but&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know! half-past nine. I came early on purpose.
To-morrow Kitty and I are coming to the
house to tea, if you will have us, Almy. We want
the Chair taken out, and the tassel-bags done up, and
the Lowestoft cups. I&#39;ll wear my best dress, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page205" id="page205"></a>[pg&nbsp;205]</span>
is a beauty. But now&mdash;may I help you dust? You
used to let me&mdash;thanks! Best of Almys!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Almeria proffered a silk duster with fingers
that trembled slightly. She and Johanna Ross had
been intimates in girlhood; she had found it hard to
forgive the slight put upon Cyrus by her friend in
leaving it with no word of explanation. She now
felt that there had been extenuating circumstances.
She had never thought to have Johanna dusting with
her again.</p>

<p class="indent">For some minutes they plied their delicate task in
silence; then:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>My stars!</i>&quot; cried Miss Johanna. She turned with
shining eyes, holding up a book. &quot;Almeria! here is
&#39;Guy Livingstone&#39; behind the Manila envelopes, where
I dropped him twenty years ago when you wanted to
burn him. Precious tome! untidy girl! Where is
your housekeeping?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Her laugh rang out triumphantly; a delightful
laugh, clear and bell-like as Kitty&#39;s own.</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Almeria laughed, too. &quot;I think you will find
no dust on the volume, Johanna!&quot; she said demurely.
&quot;I never thought it suitable for general circulation,
as you are aware, but&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Johanna gave her a kind glance.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But you kept it for naughty Johanna&#39;s sake! That
was very sweet of you, Almy. I&#39;ll take it with me
now, if you don&#39;t mind. Ah! &#39;I know men who would
have given five years of life for the whisper that glided
into his ear as he gave Miss Bellasys her candle on
retiring, ten for the Parthian glance that shot its arrow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page206" id="page206"></a>[pg&nbsp;206]</span>
home.&#39; Now <i>that</i> is the way to write, Almeria
Bygood! Nobody writes like that nowadays.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Then with an abrupt change of tone, &quot;I wanted to
ask you one or two things, Almy. You have sense,
even if you don&#39;t appreciate &#39;Guy Livingstone.&#39; People
like my Kitty, do they, Almeria?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Can you doubt it, Johanna? She is the idol of
Cyrus. I express myself too strongly!&quot; Miss Almeria
corrected herself: &quot;idolatry is not a&mdash;sentiment
which&mdash;everybody loves her, Johanna! Who
could possibly help it? She is the light of the place!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The touch of frost melted away, and Miss Almeria
glowed with tenderness.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good!&quot; Miss Johanna nodded approbation. &quot;She
ought to be! She is a blessed little Christmas candle!
And&mdash;a&mdash;about the driving, Almy! It hasn&#39;t&mdash;eh?
People don&#39;t think&mdash;you know what I mean!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Perfectly!&quot; Miss Almeria bent her stately head in
comprehension. &quot;At first, Johanna, there were a few
criticisms; only a few, and those not from persons
whose opinions carry any weight in the community.
In general, Kitty has had from the first the respect
as well as the affection of Cyrus. Her course was
unusual, but the circumstances were unusual. You
need have no fear, Johanna!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because of course,&quot; Miss Johanna paused to
straighten a calendar which was hanging awry; &quot;of
course there is no <i>need</i> of her driving, you know,
Almy!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No need?&quot; repeated Miss Almeria.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;None in the world! I have done very well; I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page207" id="page207"></a>[pg&nbsp;207]</span>
have plenty for both of us. But it was so good for
her, and she was enjoying it so, I hadn&#39;t the heart to
say &#39;Stop! Sit down, fold your hands, be a Young
Lady of Cyrus&#39;&mdash;Beg pardon, Almy! You know I
always loved it, if it did stifle me!&mdash;when she was so
gallant and having such a wonderful time. I pay
enough to make it easy for her, <i>with</i> the business, you
see. A single woman without a trade is a dog without
a tail, my dear; you know that! What are you
flashing at, Almeria Bygood? Have people been saying&mdash;<i>they
have!</i> Transparency, thy name is Almy!
They have been saying that I am&mdash;I suppose you
would never speak to me again if I should say &#39;bumming&#39;
on Kitty!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The expression is new to me!&quot; Miss Almeria stiffened
for an instant, then flashed again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course, Josie&mdash;&quot; the diminutive slipped out
unaware&mdash;&quot;Egeria and I&mdash;in fact, all your friends
knew it was absurd to suppose for a moment that&mdash;that
you would think of any such thing; but&mdash;well,
you know there are persons, even in Cyrus, of suspicious
nature; in short, my dear, I am glad to be
able to make a positive statement to the effect&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah, but you aren&#39;t!&quot; Johanna Ross turned a face
a-twinkle with mischief.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You aren&#39;t able to make any statement at all,
Almy. I don&#39;t authorize it! No!&quot; as Miss Almeria
exclaimed, protesting. &quot;You are not to say a single
word. Let Cyrus sup full on my iniquities! My dear
soul, when I say Cyrus in this sense, of course I mean
the Sharpes, and I know as well as you that they are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page208" id="page208"></a>[pg&nbsp;208]</span>
really Tinkham, So&mdash;Ah! here is Mr. Bygood!
Good morning, Mr. Bygood! What can I offer you
this morning? Something in the fancy line, my dear
Sir? A looking-glass is what you need, to see how
handsome you are. Oh! oh! if here is not Marsh Mallow!
Marshall, how <i>do you do</i>? How do you spell
&#39;fish&#39; nowadays? Do you remember, Almy? He
thought &#39;Psyche&#39; was the queerest way of spelling
&#39;fish&#39; that ever <i>he</i> saw. Ha! ha!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Judge Peters was late that morning. He had been
detained by various petty annoyances. First he had
cut his chin while shaving; then Mary wanted to talk
about the price of eggs, which was a scandal, and to
explain at length why there had been a button off his
shirt last week. A client had come blundering to the
house instead of the office&mdash;<i>most</i> annoying!&mdash;with a
flood of questions about stumpage and flowage, and
a torrent of asseverations that he wasn&#39;t goin&#39; to be
put upon, nobody needn&#39;t think he was. No l&#39;ywer
had ever got the better of him yet, his teeth was all
eye-teeth, and he didn&#39;t cut &#39;em yesterday neither, no,
sir! Etc., etc., etc. Altogether the Judge had been
tried, and was in great need of his morning paper,
and a few minutes of sedate chat at Bygoods&#39; before
going to his office. On entering the familiar door he
started; absolutely started! the quiet place was a-bubble
with laughter. Mr. Bygood&#39;s high &quot;Te-hee! oh,
very neat! very neat! te-hee!&quot; quavered above the
rest, but they were all laughing. Miss Almeria&#39;s blue
eyes were flashing with merriment, Miss Egeria&#39;s
beaming softly, as she murmured, &quot;<i>Most</i> diverting, I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page209" id="page209"></a>[pg&nbsp;209]</span>
am sure!&quot; Mr. Jordano was waving his notebook in
a state of excited rapture, while Mr. Mallow, his head
thrown back, uttered sonorous bellows of laughter.
Miss Johanna was telling stories. Standing erect, her
back against the counter, trim and elegant in her purple
broadcloth, she held them all spellbound. Her
dark eyes shot sparkles of mirth; her whole countenance
was alight with fun and mischief. At sight of
the Judge&#39;s grave face in the doorway, a shadow swept
over her own for a moment; their looks crossed gravely,
not like swords; say, like heralds&#39; staves! Next
moment the lady was laughing again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come in, Judge!&quot; she cried. &quot;Come in, Edward!
Here I am, <i>Johanna rediviva</i>! We are having a Bygood
reunion. There is one new boy!&quot; she flashed
a smile at Mr. Jordano, reducing him to the verge of
fatuous idiocy; &quot;the rest of us are all Bygood children,
and Mr. Bygood is going to call the spelling
class this minute. Go away, Kitty!&quot; as Kitty&#39;s wondering
face peeped in at the door. &quot;This isn&#39;t the
infant class. You are not born or thought of yet.
Drive up and down the street a couple of times, will
you, my dear? Or&mdash;say you meet me at Cheeseman&#39;s
in fifteen minutes! I want some lemon drops.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Kitty, with a nod of comprehension, sped away;
a little lonely at heart, seeing them all so merry.
Youth was a sad time, it seemed; when one was entirely
used to it, it would be different, she supposed.
Then she caught sight of Lissy Wibird and Nelly
Chanter posting along the street, laden with parcels
from the General Store (Adamses&#39; had no delivery; if
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page210" id="page210"></a>[pg&nbsp;210]</span>
folks wanted things, they could come and get &#39;em,
was their view). Joyously signaling, Kitty drew up
at the curbstone; swept the girls and their parcels into
the wagon, and took them for a &quot;perfectly delirious
spin,&quot; as Nelly called it, along the Tupham Causeway.
It was nearer half an hour than fifteen minutes before
she drew up at Cheeseman&#39;s, her pocket full of
apologies for keeping her aunt waiting; when, behold,
the said aunt coming slowly down the street, Judge
Peters beside her. The laughter had died out of Miss
Johanna&#39;s face; she looked gravely downward, listening
to her companion, whose face was equally grave.
Kitty wondered; might have wondered more, had she
overheard their words.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shall come very soon!&quot; said the Judge. &quot;You
will find me unchanged, Johanna, in every respect.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am glad to hear it, Edward!&quot; Miss Johanna gave
a glance half sad, half quizzical, at the Judge&#39;s handsome
iron-gray hair; &quot;I have never found the Fountain
of Youth; I am an old woman, simply and
frankly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are pleased to say so!&quot; the Judge bowed courteously.
&quot;I have never measured sentiment by the calendar;
nor do I find,&quot; the Judge&#39;s deep voice trembled
slightly, &quot;that Memory has lost any of her charm.
With your permission, Johanna, I will call to-morrow
evening.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, dear!&quot; sighed Miss Johanna. &quot;Yes, do, Edward;
I shall be delighted to see you, and so will
Kitty. Here I am, child! Had you given me up? We
had to recite our history lesson, as well as spelling.

&#39;King Canute reproved his flatterers and bade them
perceive that he was unable to keep back the rising
tide&mdash;&mdash;&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Quite so!</i>&quot; said the Judge. &quot;I wish you good
morning, Johanna. Kitty, my love, your most
obedient!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, dear!&quot; sighed Miss Johanna again as they
entered the shop. &quot;What is it Peggotty says? &#39;Drat
the man!&#39; Oh, how do you do, Mr. Cheeseman? You
have been growing steadily younger for twenty years,
I do believe!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;People do!&quot; said Kitty,</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do what?&quot; asked Dan in an affectionate
sniff. &quot;Give a person an apple?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, my Angel Poppet!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Kitty reached for an apple&mdash;John Tucker kept a
shelf of them handy by the stalls&mdash;gave it to Dan
and ate one herself for company.</p>

<p class="indent">(There should be a digression here on Kitty eating
an apple; how she succeeded in looking prettier than
usual during the&mdash;as a rule&mdash;unbecoming process;
how daintily she set her teeth into it, taking little
pretty bites; how well her teeth matched the clear
white as it broke crisply from the red. If Dan were
writing this story, he would make such digression!)</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There is no need of snorting and sneezing over
<i>every</i> crunch, Beloved! I know it is good: apples in
May! John Tucker is very extravagant. But I meant
matchmaking, Daniel dear. Do you think it is <i>ever</i>
allowable?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Daniel refused to commit himself; hinted delicately
that another apple might aid him in forming an opinion.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You see&mdash;&quot; Kitty did not speak aloud; she was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page213" id="page213"></a>[pg&nbsp;213]</span>
sure Dan understood pats just as well&mdash;&quot;you see, Beloved,
there is no sense in Bobby&#39;s going about looking
sorrowful, when there is a perfectly dear, sweet
girl, worth three of me, who&mdash;well, I know what I
<i>think</i>, Dan dear! and I won&#39;t say I am probably mistaken
as her mother does&mdash;and <i>is</i>!&mdash;and they are both
<i>just</i> as nice as they can be, you know they are, and
just the right age for each other, and he two inches
taller and all; and I do think she has a rather horrid
time at home, Dan dear! Just <i>think</i> of having to live
perpetually with the tenth and last Wilson Wimberley
Wibird! Poor creature; I wonder <i>what</i> Mr. Jordano
said to him that day! He has not been near me
since. And Mrs. Wibird is pretty lamenting, somehow;
oh dear! and I&#39;m afraid they haven&#39;t much to
do with, Dan dear!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Dan nodded thrice at this, whereupon Kitty told
him he was a gossip, and she wondered at him; kissed
his velvet nose and departed, thoughtful. She was
on her way to the Library, to get books for Aunt
Johanna, that lady being in frivolous mood, and demanding
certain mid-Victorian novels which, when
published, had caused Shudders. It was natural to
step into the stable; she almost always did, whenever
she was going out, in whatever direction. It seemed
also natural (at least it had grown to be no uncommon
thing) that Bobby Chanter should join her at the
corner and be going to the Library, too. Wednesday,
he explained, looking rather sheepish; funny
thing, but there were some books they had here that
the college library did not possess. They paced along
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page214" id="page214"></a>[pg&nbsp;214]</span>
together, the two young creatures, talking quietly of
books. Bobby did not care much for books, but Kitty
liked them, he knew. What had he been reading?
she asked. Besides study books, of course! They
took most of his time, no doubt, but one had always
to have a book on hand.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, yes!&quot; said Bobby rather forlornly. &quot;I&#39;ve got
a book; Mother gave it to me at Christmas. I&#39;ve
read quite a lot of it. I don&#39;t remember its name. I&#39;m
not sure who wrote it; think it was a chap&mdash;oh! here
we are!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Could it be possible that Bobby felt for once the
slightest shade of relief on arriving at the Library?
Kitty knew such an awful lot! he reflected ruefully,
and he was such a duffer!</p>

<p class="indent">At sight of the pair, Melissa looked up, and blushed
as pink as the ribbon at her neat collar. Melissa was
very pretty when she blushed, Kitty thought; a little
color was all she needed; how unreasonable that one
could not paint without immediately adding &quot;Jezebel&quot;
to one&#39;s name!</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Breaking a Butterfly,&#39; Lissy, please! Now don&#39;t
tell me you never heard of it, because I am perfectly
sure Bobby never did, and that makes three of us.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I never did, Kitty, honestly I didn&#39;t. I don&#39;t believe
it&#39;s in the library, unless it is one of those old,
<i>old</i> ones that haven&#39;t been catalogued yet. Old Mrs.
Spooner left them to us, you know. They are in the
inner room, waiting to be catalogued. I can&#39;t seem to
get time&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ll go look; may I? And, oh, Bobby, do you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page215" id="page215"></a>[pg&nbsp;215]</span>
want to be a <i>perfect</i> angel and look up <i>Orchis Spectabilis</i>
in Gray? We had such a dispute last night, Aunt
Johanna and I! She says its habitat is&mdash;well, find
out for me, there&#39;s a dear!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Kitty vanished into the inner room, leaving the
other two staring blankly at each other.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Spec&mdash;<i>what</i> did she say, Bobby?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Spectabilis!</i>&quot; Bobby spoke hardily, as became a
Corona senior, though he had not &quot;taken&quot; Latin since
his first year in High School. &quot;Respectable, I think
it means; something bound in gray, she said. Let&#39;s
see what there is in gray, Lissy! Here&#39;s the Life of
Hannah More; that would be respectable, what?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t believe she means that!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Melissa was fluttering very prettily. It was a most
wonderful thing to be alone with Bobby in the Library,
where she so often dreamed of him, little wistful
gray dreams with only here and there a gleam
of rose-color! How tall he was, how handsome, how
strong! how like that beautiful bust! and Melissa
glanced at the Olympian Hermes. Well, Bobby&#39;s hair
did curl, but otherwise&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t believe she means that,&quot; Melissa repeated.
&quot;Nobody has ever taken that out since I&#39;ve been here.
I looked into it once, dusting, you know; it looked
awfully poky. Perhaps&mdash;&mdash;&quot; Melissa put forth the
suggestion timidly, &quot;she meant Gray was the person
who wrote it. There&#39;s the Elegy, you know!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course!&quot; Bobby responded heartily. &quot;Sure
thing! &#39;Curfew shall not ring to-night!&#39; We learned
that at High School, didn&#39;t we, Lissy?&quot; He smiled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page216" id="page216"></a>[pg&nbsp;216]</span>
kindly on the girl. &quot;Gray&#39;s the chap; trot him out!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Melissa had not the heart to correct him. How
could she? Why should she? Men didn&#39;t have to
know poetry, except ministers, she supposed, and the
like of that. She meekly brought the works of
Thomas Gray, and they looked through them together,
making a very pretty picture, Kitty thought, as she
peeped through the crack of the door. Bobby&#39;s fair
hair&mdash;all men ought to have fair hair, of course&mdash;was
bent over Melissa&#39;s little dark head, both looking at
the same page. He sighed, which Kitty thought distinctly
encouraging.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Seems rather piffle, doesn&#39;t it?&quot; asked the youth
dolefully, looking up from &quot;The Progress of Poesy.&quot;
&quot;Kitty knows an awful lot about books, doesn&#39;t she,
Lissy? I suppose you do, too!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, <i>no</i>!&quot; Melissa replaced Gray with a look of relief.
&quot;I ought to, Bobby, but I don&#39;t. I love a good
story, and I read travels some, and the like of that,
but&mdash;oh, no! I don&#39;t begin&mdash;why, Kitty ought to be
librarian here, by good rights. She knows an <i>awful</i>
lot, simply awful. Why, she takes out books that no
one else ever looks at, and reads &#39;em same as she
would a detective story. Have you read &#39;The Hollow
Needle,&#39; Bobby?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes! Great, isn&#39;t it? Say, have you got any of
his stuff? You never can get hold of one at Corona;
they&#39;re out all the time. That chap is top-hole, no
mistake.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">When Kitty next peeped out, the two were surrounded
by the works of a certain popular author.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page217" id="page217"></a>[pg&nbsp;217]</span>
Bobby was discoursing upon their various merits,
Melissa hanging on his words. Should she slip away
and leave them together? Perhaps hardly, the first
time. A glance at the clock showed that it was nearly
closing time; at the same moment voices were heard
in the entrance hall. Kitty slipped back into the
main room and joined her two companions in time to
greet Nelly Chanter and an attendant swain, also a
Corona student, who came in quest of &quot;something
good to read!&quot; Nelly fell instantly into what Kitty
and I called Chanterics, embracing her friend with
an ardor which made the two youths blink and blush.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You darling <i>Thing</i>! I haven&#39;t seen you for forty
years! Between my teaching and your driving, Kitty,
I <i>never</i> see you! Except when you pick me up and
give me a delicious turn, like an Angel, as you did
the other day. How do, Lissy? How do, Bobby?
Kitty, this is Mr. Myers, Bobby&#39;s roommate. He
was at the Party, you know. Oh, and let me introduce
Miss Wibird, Joe! I never <i>do</i> know how to introduce,
do you? he! he! I should have introduced him
to her, shouldn&#39;t I, Kitty?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We might all begin over again,&quot; said Kitty. &quot;I
am sure Mr. Chanter has never been introduced to me!
Mr. Chanter, I am glad to have the honor of making
your acquaintance!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It takes little to amuse Youth. The Library, fortunately
empty of readers, rang with shouts of glee.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Isn&#39;t she killing?&quot; whispered Nelly to her companion.
&quot;She&#39;s just as witty as she can be, <i>all</i> the
time. She knows a most terrible lot, too, but you&#39;d
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page218" id="page218"></a>[pg&nbsp;218]</span>
never know it, she&#39;s so darling and nice. Kitty, do
tell us something good to read! Not deep things, you
know. Mr. Myers has to read enough deep things at
Corona, don&#39;t you, Mr. Myers? Ha! ha!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Kitty laughed bravely with them, wondering why
she was not amused. She must be growing old. She
named at random the latest work of a great English
novelist. Nelly exclaimed in dismay.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Kitty, that&#39;s awfully deep, you know it is.
Why, it&#39;s just <i>full</i> of religion and politics. Isn&#39;t there
anything of Summer Sweeting&#39;s in? Don&#39;t you <i>love</i>
her books? I cried <i>quarts</i> over &#39;My Burnished Dove&#39;:
perfect <i>quarts</i>! Do you think Summer Sweeting is
her own name or a <i>nom de plume</i>?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Too much sweetening for me!&quot; said Bobby gruffly:
one didn&#39;t have to make believe when it was one&#39;s
sister. &quot;I wouldn&#39;t give one of Sherlock Holmes for
all she ever wrote.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s right!&quot; chimed in Mr. Myers. &quot;I don&#39;t
stand for crying when you don&#39;t have to, what?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Joe! I <i>love</i> a sweet, sad book! Don&#39;t you
love a sweet, sad book, Kitty? Who is your <i>favorite</i>
author, Joe? I&#39;ve often meant to ask you.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Unconsciously, Nelly&#39;s voice dropped a little; her
blue eyes rested tenderly on the open countenance of
Mr. Myers, known to his mates as &quot;Jometry Joe,&quot;
owing to certain exploits of his in the region of higher
mathematics. Mr. Myers looked thoughtful.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course, Ralph Henry Barbour used to be,&quot; he
said, &quot;and they&#39;re ripping good books still, but I suppose
I read more novels now. I guess there&#39;s no one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page219" id="page219"></a>[pg&nbsp;219]</span>
to beat old Sherlock, though Fu Manchu runs him
close.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The talk ranged far and wide through the realm of
&quot;Thrillers.&quot; At five o&#39;clock, Kitty proposed that they
should all come home with her for a cup of tea and
some of Sarepta&#39;s scones, which she had just been
baking.</p>

<p class="indent">Accordingly, they closed the Library, with much
merriment of mock formality and many friendly gibes
from the lads at the Learned Ladies of Cyrus. Nelly&#39;s
swain understood that Miss Wibird read the Encyclopedia
through every year; was that so? Yes, Bobby
assured him; but Miss Ross went her one better, and
read it in French. Haw! haw! New shouts of mirth
from both gentlemen at these subtle witticisms; tinkling
peals of laughter from Melissa and Nelly. Kitty
laughed, too, feeling motherly and benignant. What
babes they were!</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But I keep my accounts in Russian,&quot; she said
gravely, &quot;and say my prayers in Siamese.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Haw, haw! Oh, I <i>say</i>!&quot; gasped the collegians.
&quot;That is rich! Russian and Siamese! I bet she does,
what?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Crossing the Common, the path narrowed, so that
only two could walk abreast. Half consciously, Kitty
stepped ahead; the others followed, two by two. This
being seen of John Tucker, who chanced to be exercising
Pilot at the moment, that calm personage
straigthway seemed to fall into a rage. He muttered
a pious execration and unconsciously tightened the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page220" id="page220"></a>[pg&nbsp;220]</span>
reins; Pilot shot ahead like a rocket, demanding with
ears and voice to know what was the matter.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Stiddy, boy! stiddy!&quot; muttered John Tucker.
&quot;Ca&#39;m down, now. I didn&#39;t mean to rouse ye up.
Them young idjits! lettin&#39; her walk alone, and struttin&#39;
an&#39; gigglin&#39; along with Lissy Wibird and Nell
Chanter&mdash;great hemlock! Well, stretch out a bit if
you&#39;re a mind to; do us both good, I expect.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Sarepta Darwin, paring apples at the kitchen window,
saw the little procession coming across the Common.
A spark crept into her pale blue eyes; she
dropped her knife and hastened to the front of the
house. When Kitty, still motherly and benignant, led
her guests up the front garden path, the door opened;
Sarepta stood there, erect, austere, as if she opened
the door invariably, instead of on the rare occasions
when she happened to feel like it.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, Sarepta, how nice of you!&quot; said Kitty, surprised
&quot;Did you see us coming? This way, boys
and girls!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She was about to enter the sitting-room, but Sarepta
intervened.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>This</i> way!&quot; she said briefly, and indicated the
Other Parlor, across the hall. Now the Other Parlor
was a charming room in itself: with delicate moldings,
and hangings of rose-color and pale gray; with
cases of family miniatures, and delightful old pastels;
but somehow, one did not sit there often; it was just
a shade formal, a trifle austere. And after all, why
should one ever sit anywhere except in the Sitting
Room? Kitty opened her eyes wide with, &quot;<i>Why</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page221" id="page221"></a>[pg&nbsp;221]</span>
Sarepta?&quot; but encountered a glance of such icy command
that as she told Nelly afterward, she could hear
the ice crackling in her spinal marrow.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This way!&quot; repeated Sarepta. &quot;Your aunt has
company in there!&quot; And as Kitty, wondering more
and more, shepherded the young people meekly into
the Other Parlor, a steely whisper hissed in her ear,
&quot;Judge Peters&mdash;on business!&quot;</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page222" id="page222"></a>[pg&nbsp;222]</span></p>

<p class="h2">CHAPTER XVI<br />
<span class="smcap">psycho-cardiac processes</span></p>

<p class="indent">Kitty was so pleased with her little party, and
so interested in seeing how many cheesecakes
and hot scones the boys could eat (&quot;There
were four dozen of them cakes, I counted as I laid
them out,&quot; Sarepta announced grimly at supper.
&quot;There&#39;s one apiece left for you two folks, and that&#39;s
<i>all</i> there is. If I was their Mas, I&#39;d give &#39;em a portion
of physic and put &#39;em to bed!&quot;) that she hardly
noticed Judge Peters&#39;s quiet departure. When the
young people reluctantly followed a little later, Kitty
stood at the window of the Other Parlor, watching
them with shining eyes. Melissa and Bobby walked
together; well, they had to, of course, with that nice
Myers boy so wrapped up in Nelly; dear Nelly!
Kitty was <i>so</i> glad! But Bobby&#39;s back was really interested,
his shoulders <i>most</i> attentive; and he did not
once turn round to see if she were standing at the
window. He always had, up to now, though of
course she never let him see her. Now&mdash;of course
he would walk home with Lissy; and then&mdash;there was
no train back to Corona before the eight-thirty&mdash;if
Lissy would only ask him in to supper!</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Because,&quot; said Kitty aloud, &quot;you see, if one could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page223" id="page223"></a>[pg&nbsp;223]</span>
make some one else&mdash;some <i>two</i> else&mdash;happy, perhaps
it would not hurt so much; do you think?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Lissy <i>did</i> ask him in to supper, in a rapture of wishfulness,
in an anguish of terror lest there should not
be enough, lest he should not like creamed fish and
baked potatoes. Bobby hesitated, guessed the folks
were expecting him at home; caught the glance of
the sweet brown eyes, and yielded. There <i>was</i>
enough; the simple refection proved to be his favorite
supper. He ate as if cheesecakes and scones had
never existed for him; ate till Lissy glowed with delight
over her own humming-bird&#39;s portion; till even
Mrs. Wibird felt a thin stream of cordiality stealing
through her poor chilly little heart, and fetched the
plateful set aside for Wilson, mentally promising him
&quot;a good scramble,&quot; which he really liked better.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Gee!&quot; said Master Bobby, surveying the total residue
of two prunes and one molasses cooky, as he
pushed his chair back; &quot;I hope Wilse gets supper with
Uncle Marsh, Mrs. Wibird. I don&#39;t seem to have left
much, do I? Mother always says my legs are hollow!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Still with that thread of warmth curling about her
heart, Mrs. Wibird hesitated a moment after leaving
the table. For the first time (except a brief space
when Lissy had croup) her house of maternal instinct
was divided against itself. She had always sacrificed
Lissy, as she had herself, to every wish of her
son&#39;s. Wilson was so particular, he had to have
things just so, or it went to his liver, and made him
bilious! He commonly occupied the sitting-room in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page224" id="page224"></a>[pg&nbsp;224]</span>
the evening; he let her and Melissa creep in with their
sewing, and sit in the corner, but callers disturbed him.
Could she&mdash;<i>how</i> could she?</p>

<p class="indent">She glanced at Bobby, cheerfully unconscious; then
at her daughter, flushing, fluttering, the meek little
drudge transfigured for the moment. Her own youth
rose up within her and struck.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You take Robert into the sitting-room, Lissy!&quot; she
said. &quot;You can light the stove if it&#39;s chilly. I&#39;ll wash
the dishes; you go right along!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Oh, blissful hour in the little stuffy sitting-room,
which yet was chilly this May evening! Oh, friendly
blinking of that one red eye of the baseburner stove!
Bobby, comforted by supper, conscious of tender sympathy
fluttering by his side in the low rocking chair,
waxed confidential; told of college pranks, of contests
on ball fields and on the river. Lissy hung on his
lips: her own were parted, her breath came quick;
she thought he must hear the beating of her heart.
Her cries of wonder and admiration warmed him still
further. His voice dropped to a lower note. It was
awfully nice of Lissy to care. It was ripping to have
some one to talk to; he was awfully lonely sometimes!
Bobby! Bobby! with three sisters, all a-quiver to share
the treasure of your heart&mdash;never mind! These things
must be.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ve been awfully unhappy, too, lately!&quot; said
Bobby. &quot;Nobody knows, but&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Out it all came! His love, his hopes, &quot;seeing Tom
was out of the running, or so everybody said,&quot; his
bitter disappointment. Out it all poured in a flood;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page225" id="page225"></a>[pg&nbsp;225]</span>
and little Lissy heard it all with tear-brimmed eyes,
with clasped hands, and soft ejaculations of pity, of
sympathy, of wonder that was almost anger. How
could Kitty? How <i>could</i> she?</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But it is all over now!&quot; Bobby rose and straightened
his shoulders manfully. &quot;Of course there will
never be any one like her in the world, but I promised
I would never say anything more, and I never
will. As she says, there&#39;s lots to life even if one isn&#39;t
happy; and she thinks we ought not to stand for kicking
because things are the way they are: not that she
put it just that way. And I shall be real glad to have
you for a sister, Lissy, and I&#39;ll tell you everything.
You must tell me things, too!&quot; Mr. Chanter added
as an afterthought, reaching for his hat. &quot;I&#39;m sure
you must have lots of things; good-night, Lissy!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He took her hand; hesitated a moment, and then
took the other.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good-night, Sister Lissy! What soft little hands
you have! What makes them shake so? I mustn&#39;t
keep you standing here in the cold!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Still he hesitated, holding the little hands in his.
How they trembled! How they seemed to nestle in
his! Kitty shook hands like another chap: her wrists
were like steel. Well, of course, driving that way,
she had to be strong. It was very pleasant to hold
the little trembling hands; if they were to be brother
and sister&mdash;perhaps? The girls were always bothering
him to kiss them&mdash;Bobby decided it would be &quot;too
cheeky for the first time,&quot; and finally departed,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page226" id="page226"></a>[pg&nbsp;226]</span>
warmer about the heart than he had felt since Madam
Flynt&#39;s party.</p>

<p class="indent">And Melissa? I believe her little cold attic glowed
that night with all the warmth and light of paradise,
and that she went to sleep lulled by the sound of silver
bells.</p>

<p class="indent">Kitty turned away happily from her window, and
crossed the hall to the sitting-room, humming under
her breath.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What is that tune you are forever humming,
child?&quot; Miss Johanna looked up from her knitting.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;The Duke of Lee?&#39; Oh, it&#39;s an old, old English
song and dance. Mother used to sing it, don&#39;t you remember?
And Tommy and I used to dance it: he was
the Duke of Lee, and I was the gentlewoman of high
qualitee. Surely you remember! How handsome you
look, Aunt Johanna!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Fiddlededee!&quot; said Aunt Johanna; she got up and
poked the fire. It was true none the less. The lady
was slightly flushed; her dark eyes were very bright;
the purple broadcloth, with touches of gold about
the bodice, was extremely becoming; certainly she
was a handsome woman.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s true!&quot; said Kitty. &quot;Just look in the glass and
see if it isn&#39;t! I wonder the dear Judge managed to
go at all, with you looking so, and the violets smelling
so, and the fire crackling so, and&mdash;he might have
waited to see me!&quot; Kitty was hovering over the bowl
of violets, drawing deep breaths of fragrance. &quot;Business,
Sarepta said. Nothing wrong, I hope, Auntie?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;N-no!&quot; said Miss Johanna, slowly and meditatively.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page227" id="page227"></a>[pg&nbsp;227]</span>
&quot;Nothing precisely wrong that I know of.
Nothing half as wrong as this knitting!&quot; she added
briskly. &quot;Come here, child! You and Sarepta Darwin
together having accomplished this atrocity of
teaching me to knit, are bound to see me through. I
seem to have done something queer here!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Kitty sat down beside her on the leather sofa, and
for some minutes both were absorbed in the mysteries
of purling, compared with which, Miss Johanna declared,
those of Eleusis were kindergarten play.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s a ridiculous tune!&quot; she remarked presently.
&quot;It keeps jigging through my head so, I can&#39;t keep
my feet still. So you used to dance it with Tommy
Lee. Tommy was a nice boy; I always liked him. Do
you ever hear from him, Kitty?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No,&quot; said Kitty quietly. &quot;I believe he is doing
very well&mdash;Mr. Chanter heard of him last winter from
a friend who had met him in the West&mdash;but I don&#39;t
know that any one has heard directly.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She did not add that, according to Cissy Sharpe,
&quot;they claimed&quot; that Tom Lee had married the widow
of a cattle king, and was spending millions on a marble
palace overlooking the Golden Gate; she did not believe
this, but it hurt, somehow. If he would only
write a line; a postal card even! Cissy had heard it in
Tinkham; she fixed greedy eyes on Kitty as she spoke.
Millions of money, they claimed! A handsome
woman, ten years older than what he was. She presumed
Kitty knew more about it than what she did;
ha! ha!</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There!&quot; Kitty handed Miss Johanna her knitting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page228" id="page228"></a>[pg&nbsp;228]</span>
and took up her own. &quot;That&#39;s all clear, dear. Now
knit straight on, ten rows, and then I&#39;ll show you
about the neck.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A long silence followed, broken only by clicking
needles and purring fire. Presently Miss Johanna
spoke, abruptly:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Elderly marriages are <i>ridiculous</i>! Grandpa Westcott
to the contrary notwithstanding. <i>Ridiculous!</i>&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Kitty started, then looked up wondering. &quot;Are
they?&quot; she said vaguely. &quot;And what about Grandpa
Westcott, Aunt Johanna?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Johanna looked a little confused. &quot;My dear,&quot;
she said, &quot;I was just thinking aloud. I was in a referee,
as old Mr. Weller says. Nothing of importance;
and then I thought of Grandpa Westcott; that&#39;s all!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did he elderly marry?&quot; Kitty roused herself with
a little effort. <i>If it were true, what did anything else
matter?</i> But that was no reason why she should be
an unsociable curmudgeon.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tell me about him, Aunt Jo! dear Father never
had time to tell me family stories, and blessed Mother
didn&#39;t know them, I suppose. Let&#39;s have a good tell
now!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She looked up brightly. Miss Johanna returned the
smile, not quite with her usual crisp composure. Her
fine eyebrows lifted and knitted in a curious little way
they had when she was disturbed; her laugh rang not
wholly clear.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I certainly cannot leave you in ignorance about
Grandpa Westcott&#39;s third marriage!&quot; she said. &quot;I
wonder at John; but he never cared about Family.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page229" id="page229"></a>[pg&nbsp;229]</span>
Little White Lily didn&#39;t know, of course. <i>Her</i> grandfather
was an archangel and her grandmother a
seraph; good gracious! Suppose Egeria should hear
me! Well, my dear, you shall have your &#39;tell&#39;; I have
brought it upon myself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Johanna paused to pick up a brand with the
tongs and lay it carefully on top of the back-log.
Kitty, turning the heel of her stocking, prepared for
a pleasant season. She loved &quot;tells,&quot; and Aunt Johanna
was the ideal story-teller.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Grandpa Westcott,&quot; the lady began, &quot;my great,
your great-great, was one of the best men that ever
lived. I remember him well; tall, dignified, handsome:
the only person I ever saw in a queue. He had had
two wives, both patterns in every way. The first&mdash;she
was a Siddall of Trimount, and a Beauty&mdash;the
Stuart portrait&mdash;had no children and died young.
The second was my grandmother, Katharine Turner;
you are named for her, of course, and you look like
her. She was not altogether plain, either,&quot; said Miss
Johanna dryly, with a glance at the lovely face that
smiled down from the wall in an exquisite pastel.
&quot;She had four children and lived to see them all grown
up and settled in life, and to be the delight of her
grandchildren&#39;s hearts. Then, when she was sixty
and Grandpa seventy, she died quite suddenly,
and Grandpa went all to pieces. Naturally! he was
a very affectionate man, and for fifty years he had
been told every day what to eat, drink and avoid, what
shirt to put on, and where his socks were. More than
that, he had been <i>listened to</i>, which is the most necessary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page230" id="page230"></a>[pg&nbsp;230]</span>
thing for a man. He mourned and he moaned,
he moaned and he mourned, till at last old Delia, who
had been with him thirty of the fifty years, sent to
the City for Uncle Doctor. I can just remember old
Delia. She had large white teeth, and used to let me
scribble on them with a pencil: <i>horrid</i> child! She
sang old Irish songs as no one else ever did: I wish
you could have heard her sing, &#39;Irish Molly O!&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Johanna broke off to sing, in a high, clear little
voice:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;&#39;She&#39;s galliant, she&#39;s beautiful,</span><br />
<span class="i2">She&#39;s the fairest one I know;</span><br />
<span class="i0">She&#39;s the primrose of Ireland,</span><br />
<span class="i2">All for my guinea, oh!</span><br />
<span class="i0">And the only one entices me</span><br />
<span class="i2">Is Irish Molly O,</span><br />
<span class="i4">Molly O!&#39;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well! So Delia sent for Uncle Doctor, and he
came. &#39;Mr. Doctor,&#39; she said, &#39;your Da is looking for
his dead clo&#39;es. If you don&#39;t find a woman for him
to marry, I&#39;ll have to marry him myself, and fine I&#39;d
look cocking in the parlor, d&#39;ye see?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Bless my soul!&#39; says Uncle Doctor, &#39;I see. I&#39;ll
attend to it, Delia.&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So Delia went back to her pots and pans, and Uncle
Doctor, after thinking a little, went down the street
and called on Aunt Elizabeth. Aunt Elizabeth was
Grandma&#39;s sister; they were like a pair of gloves, only
she was a single woman.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;Auntie,&#39;&quot; says Uncle Doctor, &#39;would you mind
marrying Father?&#39;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page231" id="page231"></a>[pg&nbsp;231]</span>
&quot;&#39;Bless my soul, Nathaniel!&#39; says Aunt Elizabeth.
So he told her what Delia said, and they talked it over.
She was a sensible woman and fond of Grandpa. By
and by, back he goes to Grandpa. &#39;Father,&#39; he says,
&#39;I want you to put on your hat and go down street and
ask Aunt Elizabeth to marry you.&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;<i>Bless my soul!</i>&#39; says Grandpa. &#39;She wouldn&#39;t
have me, Nathaniel!&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;I think she would,&#39; says Uncle Doctor.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;And what would Katharine say?&#39; says Grandpa.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;&#39;She would say, &quot;Put on your hat, and <i>don&#39;t forget
your muffler</i>.&quot;&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So Uncle Doctor put on the hat and muffler for him
and saw him out of the door, headed down street; and
he and Aunt Elizabeth were married next day, and
had ten happy years together. So there is <i>that</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Johanna rolled up her knitting briskly, and
rose from her seat. &quot;But one swallow doesn&#39;t make
a summer, Kitty, and one pair of old f&mdash; of dear old
things doesn&#39;t make folly the less foolish. I am going
upstairs, my dear. If you are watering the plants,
you might just change the water for those violets:
they are drooping a little.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dear things! so they are!&quot; Kitty rose, too, and
bent lovingly over the bowl. &quot;The new ones are due
to-morrow, aren&#39;t they, Auntie?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t know anything about the new ones!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Johanna spoke rather snappishly from the
door.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We may all be dead to-morrow, and very likely
the best thing for us. They would be nice for our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page232" id="page232"></a>[pg&nbsp;232]</span>
funerals!&quot; she added rather enigmatically from the
stairs: and the door of the Red Indian Room closed
shortly behind her.</p>

<p class="indent">Judge Peters seemed to have a good deal of business
to transact with Miss Johanna. He came regularly
once a week, almost always during the hour of
Madam Flynt&#39;s drive. This puzzled Kitty, used all
her life to being the Judge&#39;s pet and playmate. He
could not be vexed with her, for his smile and greeting
when they met was as affectionate as ever, even more
so perhaps. He pressed her hand very tenderly on
the steps one day, and said, &quot;God bless you, my dear
child!&quot; in a way that brought the tears to Kitty&#39;s eyes.
Yet he never came to see <i>her</i> nowadays!</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I do hope Aunt Johanna&#39;s business is all right!&quot;
she said to Madam Flynt one day, when that lady had
brought her in after the drive for a little visit.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I hope so!&quot; said Madam Flynt. &quot;Why shouldn&#39;t
it be? Johanna is an excellent woman of business, I
have always heard.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, it&#39;s only&mdash;well, Judge Peters comes pretty
often, and&mdash;it may be all my imagination, but she
seems rather troubled sometimes after he is gone. I
ought not to speak of this, perhaps, but&mdash;Mother
always used to come to you, didn&#39;t she, Madam
Flynt?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Madam Flynt took off her gold spectacles to wipe
her eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She did, my dear. That sweetest flower of all the
world used to bring her little troubles to me: she
never had any big ones, bless her! she didn&#39;t like to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page233" id="page233"></a>[pg&nbsp;233]</span>
bother John about the price of butter, she said. She
called me her Cousin Confessor; as if she ever had
anything to confess! But about Johanna&mdash;wait a moment,
my dear!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The door opened, and Miss Croly appeared with
the inevitable milk posset.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will take it in ten minutes, Cornelia. I am busy
now.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is the regular hour&mdash;&mdash;&quot; Miss Croly began mildly;
but she was cut short.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will take it in ten minutes!&quot; Madam Flynt raised
her voice, a rare thing with her. &quot;There is a gazelle
in the garden, Cornelia!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Croly vanished without a word. Kitty opened
wondering eyes; Madam Flynt waved her hand.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She understands. We have our private code, my
dear. Though exasperating at times, Cornelia Croly
is no fool. She will be back in ten minutes. Kitty,
my child&mdash;&mdash;&quot; Madam Flynt spoke with kindly emphasis&mdash;&quot;don&#39;t
be disturbed about your Aunt Johanna
and the Judge. They know each other like two old
shoes.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Of course! I was only afraid&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You needn&#39;t be afraid. You would be glad, I
should think, wouldn&#39;t you? Edward Peters is the
very salt of the earth, and he has been in love with
her all his life. It&#39;s the Cyrus way!&quot; Madam Flynt
added rather pettishly. &quot;One-idea&#39;d people: that&#39;s
why they are mostly spinsters and bachelors. <i>Well</i>,
Kitty! What is it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page234" id="page234"></a>[pg&nbsp;234]</span>
Kitty had risen from her low stool, pale and wide-eyed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You don&#39;t mean,&quot; she faltered; &quot;Madam Flynt,
you cannot mean that they&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Madam Flynt nodded her cap-ribbons into a perfect
dance of triumph. &quot;I mean that they are probably
going to marry each other,&quot; she announced. &quot;I
certainly hope they are! Why upon earth shouldn&#39;t
they? Kitty, do you suppose the affections run down
like a clock if they are not wound up in the early
twenties? Nothing of the sort! A man of sixty
needs a wife as much as a boy of twenty; more, in
many cases! And if ever,&quot; she added emphatically,
&quot;a woman needed a sensible man to take care of her,
and keep the bees out of her bonnet, that woman is
Johanna Ross! There! Give me a kiss, my dear,
and then run along, and tell Cornelia Croly, as you
go, that she may bring in her noxious draught. She
doesn&#39;t sleep at night if I don&#39;t take it regularly. Most
exasperating woman&mdash;and, Kitty!&quot; she called the girl
back to add impressively; &quot;if you meet your Uncle
Edward on the steps to-day give <i>him</i> a kiss, and tell
him you are thankful for your mercies!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Was Madam Flynt in league with Occult Powers?
An already sufficiently bewildered Kitty did meet
Judge Peters on the steps, just coming out of Ross
House. Some strong emotion had broken up his usual
courtly calm; his face was suffused, his eyes shone.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Kitty!&quot; he cried. &quot;Kitty, I&mdash;&mdash;&quot; He bent and
kissed her forehead. &quot;She will tell you!&quot; he murmured,
with a gesture toward the house. &quot;Blessed,-blessed&mdash;&mdash;&quot;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page235" id="page235"></a>[pg&nbsp;235]</span>
He waved his hand, almost (poor Kitty
thought) like Mr. Jordano, and departed with long,
hasty strides.</p>

<p class="indent">Kitty hesitated a moment at the sitting-room door,
dreading she hardly knew what. Strong emotions
shook her like a leaf in these days, she did not ask
herself why.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Foolish creature!&quot; she murmured.</p>

<p class="indent">She need have had no fear; Miss Johanna was pale,
and her eyes showed traces of tears, but she was entirely
calm.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sit down, Kitty, my dear!&quot; she said. &quot;Here, by
me, on the sofa. I have something to tell you. Do
you remember my quoting Peggotty the other day?
Barkis was willin&#39;, you know, and David didn&#39;t understand
the message; &#39;Drat the man! he wants to
marry me,&#39; said Peggotty. Well, my child, drat the
Judge, he wants to marry me! I haven&#39;t spoken of it
before, because if I had decided to say no, there would
have been no occasion; but he is the most obstinate
man I ever saw, in his quiet way; so&mdash;I have said yes,
Kitty. I told you, didn&#39;t I, it is he who has sent the
violets all these years? You needn&#39;t smother me, my
dear!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Kitty had her in her arms, exclaiming, caressing,
laughing and crying, all at once.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Auntie! Darling, wicked, deceitful Auntie! What
a blind bat I have been! I was afraid&mdash;oh! I am so
glad, so glad! But you always said you didn&#39;t know
who sent them.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I didn&#39;t&mdash;exactly&mdash;<i>know</i>! I only felt at the back
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page236" id="page236"></a>[pg&nbsp;236]</span>
of my head that it was probably Edward; he is that
kind of faithful, doggy person. It&#39;s perfectly ridiculous,
as I said. And&mdash;<i>my stars</i>!&quot; Miss Johanna
was all in a moment her crispest, most incisive self.
&quot;There is no possible thing that a woman of fifty can
be married in except gray or lavender, and I look like
a blown-out tallow dip in either of &#39;em. Run after
him, Kitty, and tell him I&#39;ve changed my mind!&quot;</p>

<p class="h2">CHAPTER XVII<br />
<span class="smcap">kitty sings</span></p>

<p class="indent">Miss Johanna decided finally on moss-green.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s emblematic, you see!&quot; she explained
to the Misses Bygood, who had come in state and their
best summer silks (&quot;a <i>little</i> early for them,&quot; Miss Almeria
admitted, &quot;but something festal&mdash;Johanna will
appreciate our motive!&quot;) to offer their best wishes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Our congratulations,&quot; Miss Almeria said impressively,
&quot;are for Edward.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Johanna raised her eyebrows. &quot;Poor Edward!&quot;
she said. &quot;Do you remember John&#39;s remark to
Mrs. Pringle when Emmy was engaged? &#39;I congratulate
you, ma&#39;am, on this auspicious and desolating
event!&#39; As I was saying, girls, moss-green is not only
becoming to me, it is also emblematic. Green is for
hope, which springs eternal, you know; moss is appropriate
for age. Velvet, because Edward swears
he won&#39;t marry me in anything else&mdash;<i>no</i>, Gerie; <i>don&#39;t</i>
look like that! because he likes it, and I may as well
do <i>something</i> to please him while I can. I am sorry
for Edward, but he has brought it upon himself.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Johanna is jesting, sister!&quot; Miss Almeria explained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page238" id="page238"></a>[pg&nbsp;238]</span>
kindly. &quot;We consider Edward an exceptionally fortunate
man, Johanna!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are dears, both of you!&quot; Miss Johanna&#39;s eyes
softened, and she spoke in a different tone from her
usual half-gibing utterance. &quot;I am very happy, girls,
and very thankful, as I ought to be. And&mdash;don&#39;t tell,
but, when we come back, I am going to <i>try</i> not to be
peculiar any more. Only everybody will say I was
changed at marriage!&quot; she added ruefully. &quot;Do you
suppose Cyrus will think me all the more peculiar for
trying not to be?&quot; (As a matter of fact, this is precisely
what Cyrus did think; but this is to anticipate.)</p>

<p class="indent">It was a very quiet wedding, only the few old
friends who had stood by Johanna Ross through all
her wayward years, and one new one. Mr. Jordano,
the bride insisted, must be present. She felt like a
criminal in not having a Real Wedding for Cyrus, but
Edward could not abide weddings; you would think
he had had a dozen already. The least they could do
was to have it written up in style, and that this Delicious
Creature was sure to do. Mr. Jordano did not
know that he was a Delicious Creature, but he did
know that Opportunity beckoned, and he rose to it.
Fortunately the wedding took place the day before the
weekly appearance of the <i>Centinel</i>, and Cyrus read
over its breakfast with mingled feelings, of the Event
which only a &quot;select party of choice spirits,&quot; as Mr.
Jordano put it, had the privilege of attending. (Not
that Mrs. Sharpe wondered; far from it. Marrying at
that age, Johanna Ross naturally would not wish to
have any more witnesses than were absolutely necessary:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page239" id="page239"></a>[pg&nbsp;239]</span>
Mrs. Sharpe for one was thankful to be spared
such a spectacle.) The Scribe had been one of the
fortunate few bidden to attend the nuptials of Miss
Johanna Ross, a lady who, though long absent from
our midst, was admired and revered by all who had the
privilege of her acquaintance, and our highly-esteemed
and justly celebrated fellow citizen and jurist, the Hon.
Edward Peters, Justice of the Supreme Bench. The
ceremony had taken place in the elegant and commodious
mansion of the late Dr. Ross, now the abode of his
charming and talented daughter, Miss Katharine Ross,
whose reputation as an equestrienne of the highest
order had spread far beyond the limits of Cyrus and
environs. The spacious parlors of Ross House were
tastily adorned with ferns, emerald moss (to which,
it appeared, the bride was specially addicted) and violets,
the latter in such profusion as to lade the ambient
air with perfumes of Araby the blest. The bride, a
superb brunette, wore a confection of moss-green velvet
with gold garniture, and resembled, if Italio might
take the liberty, a rare jewel in an emerald chalice.
(Mr. Jordano had written &quot;cup&quot; at first; but he liked
to murmur his copy aloud as he wrote; and &quot;cup-pup-pup&quot;
struck harshly on his ear. He was in sensitive
mood; a tail seemed to wag in the corner of his eye.
&quot;Chalice&quot; came as a happy and satisfying inspiration.)</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The bride (we read over the shoulder of Cyrus,
which is letting its coffee grow cold!) &quot;was attended
only by her niece, Miss Katharine Ross, who was indeed
a vision for the Poet&#39;s eye. Simply gowned in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page240" id="page240"></a>[pg&nbsp;240]</span>
filmy white, and which enclosed as fair a form as ever
endowed nymph or grace, the effect was <i>distingué</i>
beyond the simple pen of the Scribe to relate. The
ceremony (with ring) was performed by the Reverend
Timothy Chanter, who appeared in full regalia of
black silk, and was accompanied by Mrs. Chanter in
brown poplin with self trimmings of velvet. The
Misses Bygood wore flowered silk, with a profusion
of priceless lace, and were as ever the peers of grace
and beauty; no eye could gaze on them unmoved.&quot;
(Mr. Jordano sighed heavily after writing this, and
murmured, &quot;Almeria, to thee!&quot; in unconscious imitation
of Sir Edward Bulwer Lytton.) &quot;Madam Flynt
was sumptuously attired in lilac brocade and diamonds,
Miss Croly in purple silk. Mr. Marshall Mallow,
the genial Mine Host of the Mallow House, and
the humble Scribe who pens this tribute from a feeling
heart, made up a party which must ever esteem itself
fortunate in having been chosen to participate in
an Event which, though characterized by chaste severity
and exclusiveness, will ever dwell in the mind
as an Acme of elegance. At the conclusion of the
ceremony, exquisite refreshments were served in receptacles
of priceless porcelain and cut glass. It was
whispered in the ear of the Scribe that everything was
made in the house. Cyrus is, indeed, fortunate in
possessing a culinary artist of such dimensions as Miss
Sarepta Darwin, to whom, if Italio were rightly informed,
is due the credit of the truly superlative repast
enjoyed by the guests.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Sarepta read this next morning, and sniffed.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page241" id="page241"></a>[pg&nbsp;241]</span>
&quot;What did the man expect?&quot; she asked of Kitty,
who had brought the paper out to her. &quot;What d&#39;he
think I&#39;d been doin&#39; for forty years? The idea!&quot; but
she cut the item out none the less, and pasted it in her
scrapbook.</p>

<p class="indent">So Judge Peters won the lady of his faithful heart,
and carried her off for a summer in Europe: (there
was a Europe in those days, not yet become a place
of blood and tears!) &quot;And now,&quot; said Cyrus hopefully,
&quot;perhaps Kitty will come and live with us!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">To be exact, it was only the Chanter girls and Mr.
Mallow who said this. Madam Flynt and the Misses
Bygood knew better; so did the bride, who checked
her Edward&#39;s affectionate hope, expressed to Kitty at
parting, with &quot;Nonsense, Ned! Kitty will stay in her
own house. She would be a great fool if she didn&#39;t.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Kitty cried a good deal after her aunt left. She
missed the brusque, incisive speech, the odd, kindly
ways. The house seemed very lonely, very silent;
though of course it was just as dear. She was so glad
they were going to be happy together, those two dear
people! There would be no more violets now, she
supposed. Ridiculous that here an absurd crystal tear
dropped on the shining leaf of the orange-tree Kitty
was watering: tears came so easily nowadays, when
she was not really sad at all, only&mdash;only&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent"><i>If Tom were really married, what did anything else
matter?</i> If he were! Kitty did not actually believe it.
There were many people who did not write letters;
but to marry, without a word or a line, after&mdash;she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page242" id="page242"></a>[pg&nbsp;242]</span>
caught her breath, seeing his face as he took leave of
her that day, so long&mdash;oh, so long ago!</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I shall find you here when I come back, Kitty?
You&mdash;you&#39;ll wait&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Some one came in: next moment he was gone. That
was all. <i>If he were really married</i>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">The curious thing was, songs came as easily as
tears. She had not sung since her mother&#39;s death,
till just lately; but now, for all her sadness, which of
course was not really sadness, song bubbled within
her like a fountain. &quot;The Duke of Lee&quot; was on her
lips all day long: it possessed her; she could not drive
it away. She tried to do so by a severe course of
scales, singing her <i>solfeggi</i> twice a day religiously;
taking up, too, the Italian arias and <i>canzonetti</i> that
her mother had loved to hear her sing, and the Scotch
ballads she used to croon to her father when he came
in from a long drive and sat on the leather sofa before
the sitting-room fire. There was nothing wonderful
about Kitty&#39;s voice, but it was very sweet, and
had a harp-like quality that thrilled one strangely
somehow.</p>

<p class="indent">She set herself a stiff little course of reading for
the evening, when of course she would miss Aunt Johanna
most. Plato to begin with; she had always
meant to read Plato; then she would take Herodotus,
and Josephus, and all the things she had never &quot;got
round to.&quot; It would be wonderful! she thought. If
she kept at it steadily, by the time she was fifty, she
might really begin to know just a scrap, &quot;instead of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page243" id="page243"></a>[pg&nbsp;243]</span>
being a Pit of Ignorance, Pilot, as I always have
been; just like you, my lamb; heigh ho!</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;&#39;And she shall have silks and satins for to wear,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And a coach and six for to take the air&mdash;&mdash;&#39;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>I will not</i> sing that again to-day!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">You see, Kitty did not know, could not possibly
know, psychical processes being in their present veiled
condition, that currents were flowing, wireless messages
flashing, between her subliminal self and another;
that Tom Lee, striding up and down the deck
of his steamer, was crying all day long in his heart,
&quot;Kitty! Kitty! Kitty! I am coming! <i>Wait for me!</i>&quot;
Had &quot;Psychic Wireless, Unlimited,&quot; informed Tom
that there were other aspirants for the hand he had so
confidently thought his? Who can tell? Certainly,
he told Kitty afterward, the voyage was &quot;H. E.
Double,&quot; and ten times a day he thought of jumping
overboard and swimming the Pacific Ocean, as likely
to make better time.</p>

<p class="indent">John Tucker emerged from the harness-room, in
leather apron and gloves.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It&#39;s good to hear you singin&#39; round the place, Miss
Kitty,&quot; he said: &quot;it is so! I enjoy it, and I expect they
do as well, if they could speak.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He nodded toward Dan and Pilot, who were certainly
pictures of attention, as they stood with shining
eyes, ears pricked forward, and delicate nostrils dilated.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bless them!&quot; said Kitty. &quot;It&#39;s sugar they want,
the darlings, not singing. Pilot, stop! You cannot
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page244" id="page244"></a>[pg&nbsp;244]</span>
get your head into my pocket, you greedy cherub, and
it is Dan&#39;s turn, anyhow. Here, Dan! Don&#39;t slobber,
darling! Eat like a gentleman, because you know you
are one, a Perfect Pattern, except for just a shade of
gluttony. Now, Pilot!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">John Tucker stood in the doorway, gazing at her
with delight. She was the &quot;very moral&quot; of a picture
that hung in his own sitting-room; a steel engraving,
neatly framed. It was labeled &quot;Thoroughbred,&quot; and
showed a fair girl patting a noble horse. John Tucker
had seen it in the window of a print shop in the city
and had bought it, refusing steadfastly to tell his Mary
what it cost. Miss Kitty and Pilot might have sat for
the two portraits, he maintained, except for Pilot&#39;s
being black, which was all a Pilot colt <i>could</i> be.</p>

<p class="indent">The horses fed and petted&mdash;not to their hearts&#39; content,
but as near it as the passing nature of time would
allow&mdash;John Tucker turned back into the harness-room
with a backward jerk of his head which said as
plainly as one of Pilot&#39;s gestures, &quot;Aren&#39;t you coming
to see <i>me</i> now?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Kitty followed him into the pleasant little leather-scented
room and perched on the arm of a chair as was
her wont.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What was that tune you was singin&#39; just now, Miss
Kitty?&quot; asked John.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is called the &#39;Duke of Lee,&#39;&quot; said Kitty. &quot;It&#39;s
an old English song, John, and there&#39;s a dance that
goes with it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Didn&#39;t your Ma used to sing it now and then?
&#39;Pears to me I remember of her singin&#39; it.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page245" id="page245"></a>[pg&nbsp;245]</span>
&quot;Of course she did! You clever John Tucker to remember!
She used to sing it when I was a tiny tot,
and I used to dance. Tommy and I,&quot; she added
bravely.</p>

<p class="indent">John Tucker nodded a slow confirmation. &quot;I remember!&quot;
he said. &quot;I ricollect one day&mdash;summer day
it was, later in the season than this, and warm&mdash;I
ricollect your Ma settin&#39; on the kitchen steps, an&#39; Mis&#39;
Lee settin&#39; beside her. I couldn&#39;t but notice what a
pictur&#39; they made, kind of showin&#39; of each other off,
as you might say. What I mean, your Ma was dark,
you understand, leastways her hair and eyes, though
she had that kind of soft whiteness that you&#39;d thought
there was a light inside, if you see what I mean, Miss
Kitty&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Kitty nodded silently.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;An&#39; Mis&#39; Lee,&quot; John Tucker went on, &quot;was more
like a red and white setter pup. No offense to her
mem&#39;ry in sayin&#39; so, for she sure was a handsome
lady, and I thought the world of her&mdash;and Tommy,
too!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">John Tucker&#39;s eyes were bent studiously on the
buckle he was polishing.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But what I mean, there they sot, and honest, Miss
Kitty, I never go by that kitchen door but I see them
two&mdash;well, beautiful women is what I would say&mdash;settin&#39;
there side by each, and your Ma singin&#39; that song,
and you two little shavers dancin&#39;. I&mdash;gorry! I
wish&#39;t they was all back, Miss Kitty.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">John Tucker dashed the back of his hand across his
eyes, and gave a single portentous sniff.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page246" id="page246"></a>[pg&nbsp;246]</span>
&quot;Dear John!&quot; Kitty&#39;s eyes were brimming, too. She
stroked John&#39;s blue shirt sleeve very tenderly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dear John Tucker, I am so glad you remember.
It&#39;s a pleasant picture to remember, isn&#39;t it, John?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You bet it is!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">John Tucker very gruff with himself, and polishing
away like mad.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mis&#39; Lee, she&#39;s gone, too, ain&#39;t she, Miss Kitty?
Too bad!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, John, she died three years ago. But Tom is
alive,&quot; she added cheerfully, &quot;and doing finely, I believe.
Don&#39;t you want me to sing your own song for
you, John? The one you taught me when I was a
tiny? I have plenty of time before I go for Mr.
Chanter. Do you believe Podasokus will ever get
well, John Tucker, dear?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No&#39;m, I do not; not as long as you and Pilot are
handy by!&quot; John Tucker looked up with a twinkle.
&quot;What I mean, &#39;tisn&#39;t to be expected, though I don&#39;t
suppose Mr. Chanter senses how it is. That hoss
ought to be put away, Miss Kitty. He ain&#39;t fit to
drive, no more than an old buff&#39;ler that the moths
has got into it. Yes&#39;m, I&#39;d be tickled to death to hear
that song, if you feel like singin&#39; it. It&#39;s a long time
since I&#39;ve heard that song, Miss Kitty.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know, John! I haven&#39;t sung it since&mdash;I haven&#39;t
sung at all since Mother went, till just these last few
days. I don&#39;t know why I sing now, but somehow&mdash;now
listen, John Tucker!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Still perched on the arm of the chair, Kitty lifted up
her voice and sang &quot;Cockles and Mussels&quot; till the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page247" id="page247"></a>[pg&nbsp;247]</span>
stable rang with silver sound, and Dan and Pilot
stamped and whinnied with excitement, while even Old
Crummles, dozing in the farthest stall, raised his
sleepy head and wondered what was going on. As
for John Tucker, he wept with pleasure, openly and
unashamed; those honest blue eyes of his were always
ready for tears when he was moved.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s great!&quot; he cried. &quot;That certainly is great,
Miss Kitty. I thank you for that!&quot; he flourished a
clean blue cotton handkerchief, and blew his nose
sonorously. &quot;You weren&#39;t more than knee-high to a
grasshopper first time you sang that to old John
Tucker. Your Ma sang it, too!&quot; he added. &quot;I remember
of her singin&#39; it that same day we was speakin&#39;
of. Miss Kitty&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, John Tucker!&quot; as he stopped abruptly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I was thinkin&#39; I&#39;d take Crummles to the station
this afternoon. He ain&#39;t been out to-day.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, John Tucker. What else were you going to
say?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">John gave a short embarrassed laugh. &quot;I dunno as
I ought to say it, Miss Kitty. Wal! if you will have
it&mdash;there was something Mis&#39; Ross said that day has
stayed by me, kind of. Something&mdash;what I mean&mdash;well,
&#39;twas this way. Those two ladies was talkin&#39;
together, and I no business to hear what they was
sayin&#39;, but yet I couldn&#39;t <i>but</i> hear, bein&#39; as I was
holdin&#39; the pony. Old Rosy Nanty! he was gettin&#39;
on in years, and he liked to lay down once in a while,
and take a roll. He didn&#39;t mean no harm, he&#39;d just
antic a mite. So they was talkin&#39;, &#39;bout the children:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page248" id="page248"></a>[pg&nbsp;248]</span>
they were both wropped up in &#39;em. Mis&#39; Lee, she said
something about young uns learnin&#39; to know all sorts,
kind of mix in, like, with folks in general: thought
&#39;twas good for &#39;em and like that. And your Ma, she
bust right out: &#39;No!&#39; she says: &#39;my Kitty shall never
know anything but what is lovely!&#39; she says: and she
went on, quoted the &#39;postle Paul and like that. I
never forgot it. It kind o&#39; sunk in. You weren&#39;t
never to touch, or know, or think of, anything that
wasn&#39;t just <i>so</i>, just&mdash;well, lovely, and good report,
and that. You understand, Miss Kitty?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Kitty nodded brightly. &quot;I understand, John Tucker.
Go on!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wal! I dunno&mdash;I set here sometimes and mull
over that, Miss Kitty, and wonder if we&#39;re doin&#39; just
what&#39;s right by your Ma. There! I guess it&#39;s got to
come right out. I thought the first of it, takin&#39; Madam
Flynt for her ride and like that, &#39;twould be all right:
of course you wouldn&#39;t be let to go to no trains nor
nothin&#39; of that sort. But come to see you kitin&#39;
round with tag rag and bobtail&mdash;what I mean,&mdash;I
dunno as your Ma would <i>like</i> it, Miss Kitty. Of
course &#39;tisn&#39;t for me to say, but&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Kitty&#39;s eyes were dancing. She slipped from the
arm of the chair, and stood before John Tucker, accusatory
forefinger leveled.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;John Tucker,&quot; she said slowly, &quot;you&mdash;are&mdash;a&mdash;snob!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, Miss Kitty, don&#39;t you&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;A snob!&quot; Kitty repeated with withering emphasis.
&quot;I know perfectly well what you mean. You saw
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page249" id="page249"></a>[pg&nbsp;249]</span>
me pick up poor old Mrs. Flanagan and take her
home. John Tucker, Mrs. Flanagan is eighty if she
is a day; and that basket weighed half a ton, I am
<i>sure</i>. Would you have let her carry it, if you had been
prancing past with Pilot? I ask you, John Tucker!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">John Tucker looked uncomfortable.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Mis&#39; Flanagan has four children of her own,&quot; he
said, &quot;and ten grandchildren. She&#39;d oughter let them
carry her baskets.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, but they weren&#39;t there, and I was. <i>Try</i> to
have a <i>little</i> sense, John! as for the children on Saturday
mornings&mdash;Yes! I saw you look at us, you snobbish
John; you were coming out of Adams&#39;s: you
gave us a Gorgon glare, and I was ashamed of you!
As for the children, they are my joy and delight. I
wouldn&#39;t miss the Saturday morning drive for <i>anything</i>,
John Tucker. The lambs! didn&#39;t you see how
they were enjoying it?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I saw they was awful dirty! Took me &#39;most an
hour to get the wagon clean, all the mud they tracked
in.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;They had been playing in the mud. What should
they be doing on Saturday morning? I don&#39;t suppose
you noticed,&quot; she added demurely, &quot;that one of the
boys was named Tucker, did you, John?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I did,&quot; said John Tucker grimly. &quot;I told him I&#39;d
lick him out of his boots, if ever he took such a liberty
again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you sure it was Jimmy who took the liberty,
John?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Kitty spoke very quietly, but there was a ring of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page250" id="page250"></a>[pg&nbsp;250]</span>
steel in her voice. &quot;There!&quot; said John Tucker, describing
the scene to Sarepta that night. &quot;If it wasn&#39;t
her Pa, lookin&#39; straight at me, and lettin&#39; me have it
between the eyes, call me a juggins!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will!&quot; said Sarepta. &quot;It&#39;s what you are! The
idea!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Kitty&#39;s vexation passed like summer lightning before
John Tucker&#39;s abject penitence.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know!&quot; she said, cheering and soothing him at
once. &quot;I know, dear John! It&#39;s all your goodness
and faithfulness, and I love you for it. But don&#39;t you
see, I cannot &#39;sit on a cushion and sew a fine seam, and
feast upon strawberries, sugar and cream.&#39; That is
what blessed Mother would have liked for me, because
she <i>could</i>, you know, and because I was her baby,
and&mdash;oh, I understand so well! But I am a different
kind, you see, John. I am mostly Ross, I suppose, at
least, so Aunt Johanna says; and I don&#39;t like cushions,
and I&#39;m afraid I am not <i>very</i> fond of sewing
fine seams. When one isn&#39;t driving or walking, it
seems rather terrible not to be reading, don&#39;t you
think?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, Miss!&quot; said John Tucker, submissively. His
reading was confined to the <i>State Farmer</i>, but never
again would he differ from his idol in any particular.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;And as for what is lovely, and so on&mdash;&quot; Kitty&#39;s
eyes and voice softened to the look and tone that were
specially for her mother&mdash;&quot;I think&mdash;John, would it be
good for Pilot to live entirely on oats, and to trot always
on a perfectly level State road? No? I thought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page251" id="page251"></a>[pg&nbsp;251]</span>
not! And if he never did anything but speed in a
trotting sulky, you wouldn&#39;t say he was being of any
great use in the world? No, I thought not! And
now it is half-past ten, John Tucker, and if you don&#39;t
put Pilot into the beach wagon, I must.&quot;</p>

<p class="h2">CHAPTER XVIII<br />
<span class="smcap">old love and new</span></p>

<p class="indent">Why was Pilot put into the beach wagon instead
of the buggy? Because it was the
wedding anniversary of the Reverend Timothy
Chanter and his Susan, and they were going on
their annual picnic together. Unlike the Gilpin pair of
immortal memory, they did not take the children with
them. The children saw them off at the door, with
many injunctions to be good, and to have a wonderful
time, and not to get lost, as they did two years
ago.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Kitty,&quot; cried Lina, &quot;<i>do blaze a tree</i> at the place
where you leave them, won&#39;t you? They are not to
be trusted <i>in the least</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">On this one day of the year, the minister and his
wife cast care to the winds, locked duty up in the
cupboard, and even shut the door on parental responsibility.
They were no longer Drudge and Drudgess,
as the girls, exasperated at the vanity of efforts to
&quot;save Pa and Ma,&quot; sometimes called them: they were
Tim and Sue off on their holiday. They were to be
taken first for a spin behind Pilot, because that was
the greatest treat the Reverend Timothy could offer his
faithful partner; then they were to be left at a certain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page253" id="page253"></a>[pg&nbsp;253]</span>
place near the Lancaston Road, where the wood
dipped sharply to a cup, enclosing a round pool, with
a waterfall above it, and a ribbon of streamlet winding
away at either end. Here they would sit and eat
their luncheon, carefully prepared by Daughters; cold
chicken (dear Madam Flynt always sent them a
chicken the day before, one of her own prize Rhode
Island Reds!), nut bread (Zephine&#39;s specialty), coffee
and sponge cake (which no one could make like
Lina), and some of dear Nelly&#39;s cream peppermints
to top off with.</p>

<p class="indent">These cates disposed of, the Reverend Timothy
would light his pipe, and lean back against a sun-warmed
boulder, at peace with the world, while Mrs.
Chanter read aloud a certain chapter of &quot;Prue and I&quot;
which had been the precipitating drop in their cup of
happiness twenty-three years before. Then he would
go to sleep, dear man, and she would knit, and think
what a happy woman she was, and wonder if there
was enough mutton for to-morrow, or if she must
have a vegetable chowder. By and by, when the sunbeams
began to slant through the firs, she would wake
her lord, who would fear he had missed that last sentence,
my love! and the two would wander happily
through the wood and along the elm-shaded road, and
so home in time for the wonderful supper the girls
would have ready, and the glorified table round which
all six children would be gathered. A golden day, for
two golden hearts! May their fiftieth anniversary
find them hale and vigorous as their twenty-third!</p>

<p class="indent">This was Mrs. Chanter&#39;s first spin behind Pilot; it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page254" id="page254"></a>[pg&nbsp;254]</span>
should be her last, she resolved, as she clung terrified
to the low railing of the beach wagon. It was a bright
June morning, and Pilot was &quot;feelin&#39; extry good,&quot; as
John Tucker had intimated to Kitty; he flung the miles
behind him in a nonchalant rapture that was all his
own. Once Mrs. Chanter opened her lips to cry out,
but a glance at her husband&#39;s face of delight closed
them again. After all, the children were all grown!</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Thank you, Kitty!&quot; cried Mr. Chanter, as they
dismounted at the edge of the Lancaston woods.
&quot;<i>Thank</i> you, my dear! this has been a wonderful, <i>wonderful</i>
treat; hasn&#39;t it, Susan?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Wonderful!&quot; echoed Mrs. Chanter, dryly. &quot;Next
time I&#39;ll have Podasokus, please, Kitty; or if he has
left us, then that nice old woolly thing: Crummles, is
he? No more Pilot for me, my dear!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Kitty laughed and sped away, leaving the worthy
couple to gaze admiringly after her for a moment before
they turned into the wood, hand in hand.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Glorious girl!&quot; said the Reverend Timothy. &quot;Glorious
horse!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He&#39;ll break her neck some day!&quot; said his Susan.</p>

<p class="indent">Joy of the road on a June morning! Elms arching
overhead, in long feathery arcades, or giving way to
groups of singing pines, and clusters of white birches
that rustled and whispered together like Nausicaa and
her maidens. Under these, stretches of gray stone
wall along which the chipmunks whisked, trying in
vain to keep pace with Pilot&#39;s flying feet; stretches,
again, of stump fence, the silver-bleached bones of
ancient giants, with sturdy new growth of fir and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page255" id="page255"></a>[pg&nbsp;255]</span>
hemlock pushing up between their locked skeleton-arms.
Between fence or wall and the white ribbon of
road, a strip of green a few yards wide, sown thick
with the jewels of early summer. Ferns of every
variety, from the lady-fern which Kitty always thought
so like Mother, in the pale green dresses she loved, to
towering plumes of ostrich fern and tumbled masses
of <i>Osmunda regalis</i>. There was maiden-hair, too,
Kitty knew, hiding in the crannies of the stone wall,
but that could not be seen from the road. The cinnamon
roses were out, sweet and untidy as Herrick&#39;s
tempestuously-petticoated girl; &quot;Virgin&#39;s Bower&quot;
flung its white-starred veil over rock and tangle.
Kitty, flashing quick glances, as she sped along,
saw and loved it all. The world held no tears any
more; how should it, on a day like this?</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My heart leaps up when I behold, Pilot!&quot; cried the
girl. &quot;Can&#39;t you hear it, Beloved? And oh&mdash;and oh&mdash;and
<i>Oh!</i> pearl of Poppets, <i>do</i> you see whom we are
overhauling? Do you <i>see</i>, Pilot? If my middle name
is not Clotho&quot;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">Melissa and Bobby were walking slowly along the
road. Bobby had come over for the Anniversary
Supper, of course. It was one of Melissa&#39;s free afternoons
(the library was open only three days in the
week); it was all perfectly simple. Bobby came pretty
often nowadays, and Sister Lissy happened to be passing
the station about train time. They were near the
village now. The two were deep in talk, and paid no
heed to the approaching wheels. Melissa, who hardly
knew a baseball from a football, was listening with

bated breath and kindling eyes to a highly technical description
of yesterday&#39;s game.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Binks got base on balls, you see, and walked; then
Joyce threw to third to put out Bacon, but Hodges
fumbled, so Bacon ran home, and Binks went to second,
and then I got in a three-bagger and made a
home-run.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, Bobby! how <i>splendid</i>! What a wonderful
game! I wish I could see one!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You can!&quot; said Bobby kindly. &quot;I&#39;ll make one of
the girls bring you over next time. And I&#39;ll get you
a Corona banner!&quot; he added. &quot;A sister ought to
wear her brother&#39;s colors, what, Lissy?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It is not stated whose color it was that flamed in
Lissy&#39;s cheeks as she looked up with shining eyes; it
was very pretty anyhow, Bobby thought. He had
never realized till lately what a pretty girl Lissy was.
Hazel eyes were warmer, somehow, than gray, though
of course&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hilo!&quot; cried Kitty, checking Pilot with a touch.</p>

<p class="indent">No living horse, she always maintained, not even
Angel Dan, made such a beautiful stop as Pilot.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hilo, folks! Don&#39;t you want a lift?&quot; Glancing at
Lissy&#39;s face, she added quickly, &quot;I don&#39;t mean just
home. I&#39;m going to give this Lamb a little speed along
the State Road. Will you come?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Gee! Won&#39;t we?&quot; cried Bobby. A speed behind
Pilot was a thing rarely offered, and not to be refused
by any Cyrus youth. &quot;Come on, Lissy!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Melissa hung back. She was mortally afraid of
Pilot, and of Kitty&#39;s reckless driving. Besides&mdash;ought
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page257" id="page257"></a>[pg&nbsp;257]</span>
she not to leave them? Would he not rather&mdash;A little
cold snake seemed to creep about the girl&#39;s heart.
It wasn&#39;t fair! Kitty didn&#39;t want him till she saw
some one else&mdash;oh, Lissy! Lissy!</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Jump in, Lissy!&quot; cried Bobby joyously. &quot;You
scared of Pilot? I believe she is, Kitty! now, then!
In you go!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">In Lissy went, Bobby following; off went Pilot, at
a three minute clip. Past fled the landscape, a blur
of green, blue and white. Melissa, all in a moment
her mother&#39;s daughter, sat crouched on the seat, clutching
the rail. Bobby, in a state of high delight, glanced
at her for sympathy, and saw her pale and trembling,
her eyes brimming with frightened tears.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, Lissy!&quot; he said. Involuntarily he held out
his hand; a little cold trembling hand slid instantly into
it and was warmly grasped. Poor little hand! it quivered
like a frightened bird, yet nestled close in his, as
a bird would not.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t be scared!&quot; cried Bobby. &quot;Pilot&#39;s steady as
a rock, isn&#39;t he, Kitty? Perhaps,&quot; he added, &quot;you
might slow down just a scrap, though, Kitty. I hate
to, but&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">This was heroic of Bobby, who loved fast driving
as his father did.</p>

<p class="indent">Kitty said a word to Pilot, who cocked an indulgent
ear, and slowed down to four minutes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, Lissy,&quot; she laughed over her shoulder, &quot;rocks
are flighty compared to Pilot; positively flighty! You
saw how he stopped. I can stop him any instant, just
like that. Lean back and enjoy yourself!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page258" id="page258"></a>[pg&nbsp;258]</span>
Absorbed in her rôle of the youngest Fate, and used
to fast driving from her cradle, Kitty could not realize
the state of mind of an extremely timid girl, assailed
by mingled pangs of terror and jealousy. It
was not till they had reached the spot she had in mind
for the development of her plan that, glancing round,
she comprehended how for pleasure she was giving on
the one hand anguish, and on the other embarrassment,
if not distress. Melissa was leaning against
her companion&#39;s shoulder with closed eyes and compressed
lips: Bobby, red-faced and round-eyed, was
holding her hand. His eyes met Kitty&#39;s with an expression
of mingled deprecation, admiration and reprobation,
which was too much for that young woman&#39;s
composure.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ha! ha! ha!&quot; her laughter broke out bell-like; then
she checked herself.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh! I am so sorry! Lissy, you poor child, I never
thought&mdash;I never dreamed&mdash;Sst, Pilot!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pilot stopped, and stood like the least flighty of
rocks.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am <i>so</i> sorry!&quot; Kitty repeated penitently. &quot;Bobby,
why didn&#39;t you tell me? Are you going to give me in
charge for fast driving?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I say!&quot; cried a distracted Bobby. &quot;Gee, Kitty,
it was perfectly <i>great</i>, as far as I am concerned, but
I do suppose we were going a pretty good clip, what?
Poor little Lissy!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now, I&#39;ll tell you what!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Clotho Kitty advanced to her second parallel.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;This is where I really meant to stop. I want you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page259" id="page259"></a>[pg&nbsp;259]</span>
both to see the view from that high rock!&quot; she nodded
toward a huge boulder that frowned from the hillside
above the road. &quot;It&#39;s really beautiful, and you said
the other day you had never climbed the rock, Lissy.
It&#39;s only a minute&#39;s climb, with a good strong paw like
Bobby&#39;s to pull you up. It will shake your crinkles
out, and steady your nerves; and we will <i>crawl</i> home,
Lissy dear!&quot; said penitent Kitty.</p>

<p class="indent">Lissy dismounted and stretched her cramped limbs.
Bobby followed, with a doubtful glance at Kitty. Was
she sure Pilot would stand? Sure she didn&#39;t want
him to&mdash;&mdash;? Reassured on that point by her laughing
shake of the head, he turned to the big rock. It
was a brief, but a stiff little climb; all his energies were
required to pilot Melissa, timid and unused to climbing.
Neither of them heard the low, clear whistle, or
saw the black horse toss his head in reply, then settle
down in the shafts like a cat settling to her spring.
They gained the top, prepared to enjoy the view, which
really was fine; when Melissa uttered a cry,</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh! oh, Bobby, look! Kitty!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Pilot was off. Had something startled him, or was
it the inherent viciousness of which Melissa had always
felt sure? Off down the road like an arrow.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He is running away!&quot; cried Melissa. &quot;She can&#39;t
hold him any more than she could the wind. Oh, what
shall we do? What shall we do?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sit down!&quot; commanded Bobby. &quot;Sit still, Lissy,
till I come back!&quot; With the word, he slithered down
the rock and set out running along the road at his best
pace. It was a good pace; Bobby Chanter was the best
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page260" id="page260"></a>[pg&nbsp;260]</span>
runner in Corona. Even in her terror, Melissa noticed
how beautifully he ran, how nobly he threw his head
back, how splendid&mdash;&mdash;what horse could cope with a
Marathon runner? Then a new pang assailed her. She
crouched on the rock and wrung her hands in an ecstasy
of terror. He might be hurt, trying to stop the mad
creature. He might be <i>trampled on</i>! Wicked, hateful
horse! wicked girl to drive such a creature, risking
lives that were more precious&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">Bobby, reaching a curve in the road, saw Pilot skimming
swallow-like along the next reach. At that moment,
Kitty turned in her seat, and saw him. A flash,
a smile, a wave of the hand&mdash;she shot round a second
curve and vanished. Bobby Chanter stopped abruptly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;She&#39;s got him under!&quot; he muttered. &quot;She&#39;s going
to turn and come back.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He waited for some minutes, but in vain. No one
came. Sorely puzzled, Bobby retraced his steps, looking
over his shoulder from time to time. That horse
wasn&#39;t bolting. She had him under control all right.
What upon earth&mdash;Bobby positively scowled in his perplexity.
Had Kitty <i>meant</i> to leave them behind? And
why? <i>Why?</i> It was freakish; Kitty never used to be
freakish. It was hardly even kind; poor little Lissy,
scared to death there up on the rock. She would never
have played Kitty a trick like that. She was very sweet.
How her little hand trembled as it rested in his! A
girl ought not to be <i>too</i> independent, though of course
Kitty was the finest&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">Bobby Chanter stopped short; the blood rushed
singing up into his ears, and he stood in the middle of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page261" id="page261"></a>[pg&nbsp;261]</span>
the road, as if he had been struck. What was that
Kitty said to him, the last time he tried&mdash;A strange
thing to say, he thought at the moment.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bobby, how <i>foolish</i> you are! I really wonder at
you. You are like the man that lighted his lantern, a
beautiful, clear, bright, little lantern, and then put it
down and went after a will-o&#39;-the-wisp.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I don&#39;t in the least understand you, Kitty!&quot; he had
said ruefully, for her tone was almost sharp.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No more did the bat; I mean the man!&quot; snapped
Kitty, and she turned her back and left him. It was at
the Library door, and Melissa was just coming out.
How pretty she looked that day, too; her eyes seemed
to light up when she looked at a fellow! Was&mdash;&mdash;was
<i>that</i> what Kitty meant? He was walking again, faster
now; thinking hard as he went, putting two and two
together in a fashion new to his simple, objective mind.</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Was</i> that what Kitty meant? Other words of hers
came flocking back to him.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I <i>want</i> you to be happy, Bobby! You might be so
happy, if you weren&#39;t just a little stupid, Bobby dear!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">That seemed rather cruel at the time, when he <i>had</i>
pulled through those rotten exams. What if she
hadn&#39;t meant that at all? What if&mdash;&mdash;she was awfully
fond of Lissy, he knew; and he knew she liked him,
too, she said she did, though she never offered to be a
sister to him, as Lissy did. Lissy had a rotten time at
home, he guessed, with that Wilse, and her mother
always putting him first. She was too soft and gentle
to stand up for herself. What was that Kitty said
again? He ought to have a sweet, gentle, feminine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page262" id="page262"></a>[pg&nbsp;262]</span>
girl, not a daughter of Jehu, who drove furiously. He
hadn&#39;t understood that, either. Had he been a Nut
all this time? Hark! what was that?</p>

<p class="indent">A sound came to his ears; a breathless, sobbing
wail.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bobby! oh! Bobby!! oh, my heart!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A great clump of lilacs hid the road ahead. Hastening
round it, he saw Melissa running toward him, crimson,
panting, the tears rolling down her cheeks as she
sobbed and ran and sobbed again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Allow two minutes!&quot; says Mr. Ezra Barkley in an
immortal Tale. Bobby did not allow one. In ten seconds
he had gathered his little sweetheart in his arms,
pulled her in behind the big lilac bush, and was soothing,
comforting, pouring tender words into her ear.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There, dear; there, Lissy! there, my little girl!
You are my little girl, aren&#39;t you? My own dear little
girl! Don&#39;t cry, sweetheart! What frightened you,
Lissy?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh! oh!&quot; sobbed Lissy. &quot;I thought he would
trample on you. I thought you would be lying on the
road all dead and bleeding. Oh, Bobby! Bobby! Did
he hurt you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Did who hurt me, darling? Here! let&#39;s sit down!
Put your dear little head on my shoulder; so! comfy?
Did who hurt me, Lissy?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The dreadful horse! I thought he would trample
on you! oh! oh!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She started at Bobby&#39;s shout of laughter.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Lissy! <i>honestly!</i> you didn&#39;t think I could catch
Pilot? Gee! that is a good one!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page263" id="page263"></a>[pg&nbsp;263]</span>
The great lilac bush had seen lovers in its day; sheltered
them, too. A generation ago, it had marked a
gateway; the cellar hole of the house still yawned in
the field, half filled with wild raspberry bushes. If
not Jemmy and Jessamy, at least Zekle and Huldy, or
their prototypes, had sauntered down the lawn with
arms linked, and had sat under the great bush, sheltered
from lane and road by tossing, purple plumes.
Yes, the lilac bush knew all about it, and bent kindly
over Bobby and Lissy as they sat in their turn, hand
in hand, pouring out the wonderful new story that
had never, never, never been told before.</p>

<p class="indent">By and by (for not even new love could make Bobby
unconscious of Dinner Time!) they walked home, and
the road was paved with gold, and the skies above were
diamond and sapphire, and the world was very fair.</p>

<p class="indent">And Kitty? If the truth must be told, they did not
once think of Kitty till they reached the Wibird door.
Then Melissa, with a conscience-stricken blush, wondered
if Kitty was all right, and Bobby, with another,
guessed she was. Then his honest heart smote him,
and after one last look and handclasp, he went straight
off to Ross House and told Kitty all about it. Then
who so happy as Clotho Kitty? She took Bobby&#39;s
hands and danced up and down the hall with him. She
had not been so happy, she vowed, since she was probably
arboreal. Never mind what she meant! She was
just sitting down to dinner, all alone, and Bobby must
and should sit down with her. They would have a
feast, the Feast of Friendship. There was chicken pie!</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Come on, Bobby! we&#39;ll drink all our healths in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page264" id="page264"></a>[pg&nbsp;264]</span>
pineapple lemonade. Sarepta! Sarepta! Put another
plate, will you? Bobby is stopping to dinner!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Sarepta laid another plate, outwardly grim, inwardly
rejoicing. Men folks seemed to have more
real understanding of pastry than what women-folks
did, some way of it. She thawed visibly with every
crunch of Bobby&#39;s enraptured teeth. She brought ham
and tongue and little crisp home-made sausages the
size of Bobby&#39;s little finger, over which he fairly
groaned with delight.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Honestly, Sarepta!&quot; he kept saying. &quot;Honestly!
On the square now, I never <i>did</i>!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">When it came to fruit jelly with whipped cream,
Bobby sighed deeply, and Kitty had an inspiration.
She caught up the pretty dish and rose from table.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are to take this straight down to Lissy and
eat it with her!&quot; she commanded. &quot;Hush! not a
word! Sarepta, a fringed doily, please! Bobby is going
to take this to&mdash;&mdash;may I Bobby? Sarepta is a <i>tomb</i>
of secrecy!&mdash;&mdash;to his dear, sweet, darling Melissa, and
eat it with her. One more glass, Bobby! Sarepta must
have one too! To the health of Mr. and Mrs. Robert
Chanter! Hip! hip! hooray!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Honestly, Kitty!&quot; Bobby&#39;s voice faltered and
broke. &quot;Honestly! You are the greatest girl in the
world&mdash;bar one, I&#39;ll have to say now, won&#39;t I? Good-bye!
God bless you, Kitty!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, of all the Actions!&quot; said Sarepta Darwin.</p>

<p class="h2">CHAPTER XIX<br />
<span class="smcap">&quot;the trivial round&quot;</span></p>

<p class="indent">I think the next month was the hardest that
Kitty had to encounter in what she used afterward
to call her Woful Waiting. Of course she
missed Miss Johanna&mdash;I beg her pardon!&mdash;Mrs. Peters,
wofully. Ever since she came back (after the
first few days, that is) she had had this bright, sharp,
cheery person to go to, to talk and take counsel with.
I always supposed that one reason for Miss Johanna&#39;s
taking to her bed was her wish to let Kitty live her own
life. Indeed, she said as much one day while I was
sitting with her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes!&quot; she said, with her little brisk snap. &quot;I see
just as much of Kitty as she likes. I don&#39;t poke about
in her house; I wouldn&#39;t have anybody poking about in
mine. When she wants me, I am here, delighted to
see her. When she doesn&#39;t&mdash;well, I am here just the
same, and not downstairs under her feet. Blessings
of the Bedridden, my dear. Appreciated by few, but
tangible none the less.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">My visit in beloved Cyrus had ended long before
this, but Kitty had dropped a word now and then in
her letters; and Nelly Chanter wrote me that they
were all worried about her.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page266" id="page266"></a>[pg&nbsp;266]</span>
&quot;She is as gay and cheery as ever, but she doesn&#39;t
<i>look right</i>. I am perfectly sure she has lost <i>pounds</i>,
though of course nothing would persuade her to be
weighed. You see, that cat Cissy Sharpe got hold of
a western paper somehow in Tinkham, with the account
of the marriage of <i>Thomas Leigh</i> to a rich
widow, millions, marble palaces, that kind of thing.
She didn&#39;t <i>show</i> Kitty the paper, just told her about it
in the street, and she said Kitty went white as milk and
didn&#39;t say a word, just walked away, looking as if
she were blind. Then she&mdash;Cissy&mdash;came to Lina and
me, open-mouthed, as you can imagine: I tell you we
<i>gave</i> it to her! And Lina, in her quiet way, cross-examined
her and got out of her that it was <i>Leigh</i>
and not <i>Lee</i>. Did you <i>ever</i>, Mary? Well, the next
time I saw Kitty, I managed to lead up to it&mdash;talking
about Bobby and Lissy (yes, we are all <i>very</i> fond
of Lissy, and it is <i>all right</i>, though, of course, it was
a blow <i>at first</i>, after all our hopes; but Bobby is so
happy, of course we are too!) well, and so I spoke of
the report, about Tom and the different spelling, said
I didn&#39;t believe it was our Tom at all, and so forth and
so on. She just listened, that little quiet way she has
when she doesn&#39;t agree with you,&mdash;you know&mdash;her
head a little on one side, looking down: and said yes,
very likely. That was all I could get out of her; but,
Mary, I think she has made up her mind that he <i>isn&#39;t
coming back</i>; and I think her heart is breaking, and
all ours are breaking for her.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">This was partly true. Kitty did at this time make
up her mind that Tom was not likely to come into her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page267" id="page267"></a>[pg&nbsp;267]</span>
life again; she has told me that since, and that she was
very unhappy for a while; but as to breaking her
heart&mdash;Nelly always was sentimental. Kitty is not.
She just looked the thing straight in the face&mdash;that
reminds me of something she said, that puts it all in a
nutshell. It was on my first visit after her marriage,
and we were talking over our sewing, sitting on the
old leather sofa. She spoke of the Woful Waiting.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It wasn&#39;t really so bad!&quot; she said. &quot;It was&mdash;do
you remember that verse in the &#39;Ancient Mariner&#39; that
always frightened me so?</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;&#39;Like one that on a lonesome road</span><br />
<span class="i2">Doth walk in fear and dread,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And having once turned round, walks on,</span><br />
<span class="i2">And turns no more his head,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Because he knows a frightful fiend</span><br />
<span class="i2">Doth close behind him tread.&#39;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">&quot;That used to come to me in the long passages upstairs,
and I would run&mdash;oh, how I ran! Well, Mary,
it was like that. Ever since I came back and found no
word from Tom, I had felt this behind me. I had just
seen it over my shoulder and I wouldn&#39;t turn round and
look at it: I was afraid. But when I heard&mdash;that, you
know; something definite, whether it was true or not&mdash;I
turned square round and looked at it, and I found it
wasn&#39;t so frightful after all. I wanted Tom to be
happy, didn&#39;t I? I didn&#39;t want him back if he didn&#39;t
want to come. I saw all the dear neighbors, so many
of them living single&mdash;really <i>most</i> of them, Mary!
Cyrus is the most unmarried place that ever was, I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page268" id="page268"></a>[pg&nbsp;268]</span>
do believe! and all so good, and so happy and busy&mdash;why,
I said, &#39;Goose! do try to have a <i>little</i> sense!&#39; That
helped me ever so much, Mary. I don&#39;t say I liked
it, you know, but&mdash;well, it was easier because it was
harder, if you see what I mean. And then&mdash;I began to
do things, and that helped too.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">I had heard of some of the things she began to do
at this time. It was then that she began the Saturday
picnics for the school children, taking a wagonload
of them out with Old Crummles to some lovely pasture
or woodpiece, and frolicking with them all the
morning. Then would come the feast: always chicken
pie, because Kitty thought children liked that better
than anything else (except icecream, which was sloppy
to take on picnics) currant buns and raspberry tartlets
and lemonade in a stone jug. What times those
children did have! Then, too, little by little, she
found out all the &quot;poor things&quot; for miles around. Half-invalids,
who needed carriage exercise; tired country
women who had no horse and could not walk so far as
the village for their errands; sad people with few
&quot;privileges,&quot; to whom a cheery call, a book or magazine
or nosegay would change the hue of a whole day
from drab to rose-color. Kitty found them all out,
and took them &quot;buggy-riding,&quot; or sat on their steps
and told them gay little stories. Every child for ten
miles round Cyrus knew her, and set up a shout of
&quot;Miskitty! Miskitty!&quot; (the first syllable strongly accented!)
&quot;gimme a ride!&quot; She loved them all, but
John Tucker often wished there was no such a thing
as young uns in the endurin&#39; world.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page269" id="page269"></a>[pg&nbsp;269]</span>
She told me of a pleasant happening.</p>

<p class="indent">One day she brought old Mrs. Grieven in to do some
shopping, and waited outside Cheeseman&#39;s while the
old lady pottered in and out of the various stores. Just
in front of her stood a peddler&#39;s wagon, very neat
and trim, with a brown horse attached to it. A bag
was attached to the horse&#39;s nose, and he was asleep.
Kitty looked him over approvingly. A good horse;
a bit cobby and stocky; no speed, she judged, but much
steadiness, and&mdash;she added mentally, as the horse
waked and turned an appraising eye on Dan&mdash;some intelligence.
At this moment Mr. Cheeseman&#39;s door
opened and a man came out; a tall, loose-jointed brown
man, with a sea-going air about him. A new face to
Kitty: she loved a new face; a good one, too. Their
eyes met; the brown man made a little gesture, as
friendly as it was courteous. His arms were full of
glass jars, small and large, containing bright-hued
candies; these he proceeded to stow away carefully on
the shelves of the neat cupboard at the back of his
wagon. Over the shelves were drawers, labeled
&quot;Lozenges,&quot; &quot;Jujubes,&quot; etc., etc. These he filled with
neat rolls and parcels produced from various pockets.
As he worked he hummed and whistled under his
breath, and presently broke into song, in a mellow
baritone voice.</p>

<p class="indent">Kitty was reserved enough in some ways, but she
never could restrain her laughter; she gave a little
crow at the fate of &quot;Renzo,&quot; the conclusion, had she
but known it, of an eventful life. The brown man
turned with a responsive chuckle.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;There!&quot; he said. &quot;I was warblin&#39;, warn&#39;t I? You
must excuse me, lady; I&#39;m a sea-farin&#39; man, and I
have to warble, &#39;pears though: I b&#39;lieve I warble in my
sleep.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was so funny, I couldn&#39;t help laughing!&quot; said
Kitty. &quot;Poor Renzo! is there any more about him?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, my, yes! old Renzo! There&#39;s more songs and
chanteys about him than you could shake a stick at.
Renzo or Ranzo&mdash;I&#39;ve heard much as a dozen of &#39;em.
This one&#39;s the only one I know clear&#39;n through,
though.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh! please! won&#39;t you sing it all for me?&quot; Kitty
leaned forward, her eyes aglow.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Why, it ain&#39;t nothin&#39; but an old sailor song, you
understand, but you&#39;re welcome to it, such as &#39;tis.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Leaning comfortably against the back of his wagon,
his brown gaze wandering placidly up and down the
street, the brown man sang as follows:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh! thank you!&quot; cried Kitty. &quot;Thank you ever
so much!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I thank you,&quot; replied the brown man, &quot;for listenin&#39;.
I expect you&#39;ve had the hardest job of the two,
if all was known.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He stepped to the head of the brown horse, felt of
the bag and shook his head; the brown horse shook
his.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Hossy,&quot; he spoke slowly, in a singularly cordial,
pleasant tone, &quot;you ain&#39;t eat your dinner!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The horse shook his head again and sneezed.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You no call to sneeze!&quot; said the brown man. &quot;It&#39;s
good feed, and you&#39;ve had time enough. I can&#39;t wag
your jaws for you! If you expect that, Hossy, you&#39;re
liable to be disappointed right away! Sam&#39;ll be in forty
conniptions now because I&#39;m late!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He took off the nose-bag and folded it deliberately,
the brown horse continuing to sneeze protest. Looking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page273" id="page273"></a>[pg&nbsp;273]</span>
up, he met Kitty&#39;s interested eyes again, and his
face broke into a delightful smile.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He&#39;s a mite choosy to-day!&quot; he said, nodding toward
the animal. &quot;Sometimes he forgets he isn&#39;t a
bein&#39;. I expect I make of him more&#39;n I should, but
you know how &#39;tis. That&#39;s a fine hoss you&#39;re drivin&#39;,
lady. A No. 1, I should rate him, clipper-built and
copper&mdash;what I would say, he&#39;s an elegant hoss. Might
I take the liberty of offerin&#39; you a pep&#39;mint, Miss? No
offense, I hope; they&#39;re just out o&#39; the pan.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The two talked horse happily for five minutes; then
the brown man climbed somewhat laboriously into his
wagon, and with &quot;Good day! Pleased to have met up
with you!&quot; drove off. Kitty sprang down and ran
into the shop.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Uncle Ivory,&quot; she cried, &quot;who is that nice man?
Isn&#39;t he a perfect duck? Do tell me who he is!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Cheeseman had watched the interview, and his
eyes were twinkling.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;As to bein&#39; a duck,&quot; he said slowly, &quot;I couldn&#39;t say.
I never see him without his stockin&#39;s. Feet may be
web, for all I know. That&#39;s Calvin Parks,&quot; he added
in a different tone. &quot;He&#39;s what I might call, if I was
put to it, the best man in this world. If he wasn&#39;t a
gump, he&#39;d be an angel. He peddles candy. I supply
him reg&#39;lar, and I tell ye, Kitty, I fairly look forward
to the day he comes, once a week.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I should think you would! Where does he live?
Not in any Cyrus, surely?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;He lives over yonder!&quot; Mr. Cheeseman nodded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page274" id="page274"></a>[pg&nbsp;274]</span>
toward a point of the compass. &quot;Drives a candy
route, and looks out for the Sill boys, him and his wife.
Awful nice woman she is, too. You&#39;d like Mary
Parks. Try that pineapple ribbin; I expect it&#39;s
good!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At this point Mrs. Grieven appeared, lamenting.
&quot;Wesleys&quot; had no yellow flannel, and it was a living
shame, she must say, if she was to go without a flannel
petticoat at her time of life.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;But he has other colors, Mrs. Grieven!&quot; Kitty tried
to console her. &quot;I know he has red flannel, for I
bought some the other day; and white he has too, and
I think gray.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ve worn yellow flannel for seventy-seven years,&quot;
Mrs. Grieven replied; &quot;and I&#39;m not going to change at
my time of life. Yellow flannel is healin&#39; to the bones,
and keeps off rheumatism; &#39;tis well known, and Orison
Wesley ought to be ashamed to call himself a
general store, and not keep&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;We&#39;ll talk about it as we drive!&quot; said Kitty
brightly. &quot;I think we must start now, Mrs. Grieven.
The &#39;ribbon&#39; is delicious, Mr. Cheeseman; thank you so
much! Let me know when you expect Mr. Parks
again, won&#39;t you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Uncle Ivory Cheeseman watched her as she drove
off.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now she&#39;ll sup yellow flannel all the way to North
Cyrus!&quot; he commented; &quot;and take it as if &#39;twas butter
scotch. Them kind of folks, you sympathize with
them, and they&#39;re all over you in a minute, like a wet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page275" id="page275"></a>[pg&nbsp;275]</span>
dog on a cold day. It&#39;s one thing to be friendly, but,&mdash;well,
the Bible says to suffer fools gladly, but it
don&#39;t say to encourage &#39;em, and so I tell Calvin!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He turned, and gave his mind to the molasses peppermints.</p>

<p class="h2">CHAPTER XX<br />
<span class="smcap">the pan-american</span></p>

<p class="indent">If little has been said hitherto of Miss Ruby Caddie,
it is not because she was not an Institution
of Cyrus; far from it! She was even more than
that, though that would be enough for most people;
she was a National Institution; she was the Pan-American!
Miss Ruby spent her days in a box measuring
eight feet by ten, glazed on two sides; one window
giving on the street, the other on a small and dingy
space which she called the Outer Office. The other
two sides were profusely adorned with illuminated
texts, of cheerful and admonitory nature. Miss
Ruby&#39;s visitors were advised that this was Her Busy
Day; that it was proper to Smile While You Wait:
that</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;When Time is withdrawn,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Will Eternity dawn!&quot;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">etc., etc. The latter sentiment was also inscribed
in letters of gold (decalcomania!) on a manuscript
book which lay on Miss Ruby&#39;s desk, and which was
further labeled &quot;Timely Texts for Troublous Telegrams.&quot;
This volume (a birthday present from Miss
Pearl, who had spent a happy year in its compilation)
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page277" id="page277"></a>[pg&nbsp;277]</span>
was a constant help to Miss Ruby in discharging the
responsibilities of her position, of which she was
acutely conscious. The electric telegraph was to her
sensitive nature no mere affair of keys, wires and
switches: no, indeed! &quot;It is a <i>Mighty Force</i>,&quot; the
little lady was wont to say, shaking her flaxen ringlets
impressively, &quot;which through my agency raises the
heart to the summit of joy or plunges it in the gulf of
despair.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Holding these views, Miss Ruby felt it her duty to
wing the joyful message with special shafts of cheer,
and to prepare the way for the sorrowful one with
remarks of a fortifying nature. She invariably began,
&quot;<i>Good</i> morning! (or afternoon, as the case
might be). This is the Pan-American Telegraph Company.&quot;
Then would follow, &quot;Do not be alarmed! the
news is of a cheering nature.&quot; And then the listener
would learn that her Aunt Maria was coming that evening
by the 8:3O train, or that John Henry had passed
his college examinations. But were the message one
of sorrowful import, Miss Ruby before delivering it
would open the manuscript volume and select an appropriate
sentence: then we might hear &quot;Trouble is
often benefit in disguise. Permit me to express my
sympathy before delivering the following message.
&#39;Your Aunt Maria passed away last night; a blessed
release.&#39;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">With these lofty views of her responsibilities, it
need not be said that Miss Ruby was the soul of conscientiousness
in regard to the winged words of which
she was the transmitter. Not even to Miss Pearl, her
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page278" id="page278"></a>[pg&nbsp;278]</span>
twin sister and other self, would she breathe a whisper
of what passed over the wires. Miss Pearl, equally
conscientious, respected her sister&#39;s reserve. If questioned
by some thoughtless neighbor, she would say,
&quot;My sister has her business, and I have mine. I
should no more think of asking her about the messages
she receives than she would ask me the amount of
your bank deposit. We are in positions of Public
Trust!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Once only, in all the years of her service, was Miss
Ruby tempted to break her rule of silence; that was on
a certain June evening, not long after the events narrated
in the last chapter. Miss Pearl had not visited
the office that afternoon; it was &quot;the birthday of Sister
and Self,&quot; as she happily announced to all she met on
her way home, and she must prepare for the Treat.
The Treat consisted of creamcakes, bought at the bakery,
as she hastened homeward; large pale yellow shells
of brittle crust, irregularly paneled like alligator-skin,
filled with a glutinous semi-liquid substance of irresistibly
flowing nature. There were other delicacies
of home manufacture; stuffed eggs, and what Miss
Pearl called &quot;lion&#39;s potatoes,&quot; with buttered toast and
pickles; but the creamcakes were the real Treat, as
they had been ever since the little Twins earned their
first five cents apiece by picking berries for Madam
Flynt. There were three creamcakes; two apiece
would be too much; on the other hand, one was not
quite enough; so the third was cut in two, with astonishing
results in the way of swift pursuit and skillful
capture (with spoons) of the glutinous substance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page279" id="page279"></a>[pg&nbsp;279]</span>
before mentioned. The cakes were displayed upon a
beautiful old platter of &quot;flowed blue,&quot; the pride of
the ladies&#39; hearts. Have I said too much about the
Treat? I always thought it so dear and funny! and I
never can forget how I chanced in on an errand one
Birthday evening, and found the Twins half way
through their whole cakes. They held them in their
hands, and darted from edge to edge as the custard
threatened to overflow here or there. They offered me
the third cake; dear little ladies!</p>

<p class="indent">On the evening in question, Miss Ruby was not in
her usual spirits. She praised the &quot;lovely supper,&quot;
which Sister had prepared, and joined in the annual
duet of admiration for and joy in the flowed blue
platter, the pink lustre jug, and the sprigged tea-set.
The sisters found it convenient, as I have said, to
spend their winters at the Mallow House. It was
economical, Mr. Mallow being more than liberal in his
rates for &quot;permanents&quot;; it was also social, and saved
much time in getting to and from their business, for
their cottage was quite at the end of the village; but
perhaps the happiest day of the year for the sisters was
that on which they &quot;got back to their dishes!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;For there is nothing like <i>your own</i>!&quot; said Miss
Pearl, shaking her curls. &quot;Not but what Mr. Mallow&#39;s
pattern is handsome; it <i>is</i>, for them that likes a
band. But when you have grown up with a sprig,
nothing else is quite the same, seems as though.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Ruby, as I say, joined in the duet, but not,
her observant twin thought, with her customary heartiness.
Neither did she show her usual keen enjoyment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page280" id="page280"></a>[pg&nbsp;280]</span>
of the eggs (scrambled this time, with crisp
curls of bacon surrounding them) and the lion&#39;s potatoes.
She was absent-minded and took little notice
even of the Sally Lunns. All this might have passed as
the result of fatigue, or an exceptionally busy day; but
when, on finishing her creamcake, Miss Ruby refused,
positively refused, her half of the odd one, Miss Pearl
spoke with conviction.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sister,&quot; she said, &quot;you have something on your
mind; do not deny it!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sister,&quot; replied Miss Ruby, &quot;I <i>have</i>. Do not press
me! I cannot eat another morsel.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">A troubled silence ensued. The table was cleared,
the dishes washed and put away, but not to the customary
accompaniment of cheerful babble. Miss Ruby
sighed deeply over her &quot;wiper,&quot; one of a set presented
by Mr. Mallow as a birthday gift. Miss Pearl, the
elder by half an hour in this world, and with all her
maternal instinct centred in her sister, yearned to
comfort her; but the bond of discretion and custom
kept her silent. Anything that Sister felt at liberty
to communicate, she would; far be it from Miss Pearl
to intrude upon the sanctity of Office!</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Ruby was the first to break the silence.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Let&#39;s we come out on the stoop!&quot; she said. (The
Misses Caddie never forgot that their father, the
late lamented Cassius M. Caddie, had been a New York
Merchant. They were only ten years old when he
died, and their mother brought them back to her
native Cyrus, but they said &quot;stoop&quot; for &quot;porch&quot; and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page281" id="page281"></a>[pg&nbsp;281]</span>
&quot;aquascutum&quot; for &quot;waterproof,&quot; as long as they
lived.)</p>

<p class="indent">The sisters went out on the porch&mdash;I beg their pardon!
the stoop!&mdash;and sat down on a bench at the side.
It was a lovely evening; the air was full of peace and
silence, broken now and then by a low call from some
nesting bird. Miss Ruby sighed again.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sister,&quot; Miss Pearl spoke timidly; &quot;could you feel
to free your mind? You know that anything you
might say would be sacred&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I know it well!&quot; Miss Ruby touched her twin&#39;s
shoulder lightly; it was in the nature of a caress;
they had not been brought up to kiss.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I will own this much to you, Sister, that never, in
the course of my professional career, have I been so
tempted to speak as I am this night.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She paused; Miss Pearl made a little sound expressive
of sympathy and concern.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is not only,&quot; Miss Ruby went on, &quot;the extra-ordinary
nature of the message itself, though&mdash;well,
Sister, you really <i>never did</i>!&mdash;but it is the feeling&mdash;&quot;
Miss Ruby glanced around her in the dusk and lowered
her voice&mdash;&quot;the feeling that the sanctity of the
Office has been <i>already violated</i>.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sister Ruby! how <i>could</i>&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I feel it so to be! this much I can say, and will.
Pearlie, the message was for Kitty Ross, from California.
I delivered it by telephone as usual. &#39;Kitty,&#39;
I said, &#39;do not be alarmed; the message, though <i>most
unusual</i>, is not otherwise than cheerful, if correctly
transmitted, though of course at that distance it is impossible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page282" id="page282"></a>[pg&nbsp;282]</span>
to be sure.&#39; Then I gave her the words of
the message&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes, Sister!&quot; Miss Pearl&#39;s voice was tense with
eagerness.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;The words of the message!&quot; Miss Ruby seemed to
be holding herself in forcible restraint. &quot;I then asked
her if it was clear, and she made answer that it was.
To make quite sure, I asked her to repeat it, and she
so did. Then she hung up; and&mdash;Sister, at that living
moment of time, <i>some one else hung up</i>! I cannot be
deceived;&quot; as Miss Pearl uttered a cry of amazement,
&quot;and it is not the first time that it has happened, but I
am resolved it shall be the last. That&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good evening, girls!&quot; a high-pitched voice broke
in on Miss Ruby&#39;s low, impressive tones. Mrs.
Sharpe appeared, slightly out of breath as usual.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I thought I&#39;d make a run in, and wish you joy; not
that birthdays is all joy in this world, especially when
you&#39;re on in years. You&#39;re gettin&#39; quite gray, ain&#39;t
you? Well, Ruby, <i>what</i> do you make of that message?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Ruby grew rigid. &quot;To what do you allude,
Sophia?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Sharpe laughed, a high excited titter. &quot;That
telephone!&quot; she cried: &quot;it is the beat! I keep tellin&#39;
and tellin&#39; Jonas Chamberlain, and he doesn&#39;t do a
thing about it. Everything that goes to Kitty Ross&#39;s
goes <i>right through</i> my house. I s&#39;posed you knew, of
course. It&#39;s real annoying; I should think they would
stop it. But&mdash;well, if that is <i>so</i>, girls, we shall see
great times in Cyrus, what say, Pearlie?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page283" id="page283"></a>[pg&nbsp;283]</span>
&quot;I do not understand you!&quot; Miss Pearl spoke
stiffly.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What!&quot; Mrs. Sharpe bent forward eagerly, trying
through the twilight to scrutinize the features of the
twins. &quot;You don&#39;t mean to say&mdash;you don&#39;t mean
Ruby <i>hasn&#39;t told</i> you? Well! It&#39;s <i>my</i> belief that
such things should be made public. The idea! Is this
a Republic, I ask you, or a Monarchy? &#39;<i>Coming, coach
and six. Duke.</i>&#39; Did you ever? If that isn&#39;t English
Aristocracy trying to lord it over&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She stopped. The twin sisters had risen to their
feet; their round spectacles glistened through the dim
twilight.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sophia Sharpe!&quot; Miss Ruby spoke slowly, her
curls nodding emphasis. &quot;Sophia Sharpe, you have
tampered with the sanctity of Public Office. I <i>forbid</i>
you to repeat what you have criminally&mdash;I repeat,
<i>criminally</i> overheard!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You ought to be ashamed of yourself!&quot; piped Miss
Pearl, her bird-like voice shrill with indignation. &quot;To
cast reflection upon Sister&#39;s faithfulness in office!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh!&quot; Mrs. Sharpe&#39;s tone was shriller yet. &quot;I&#39;ve
come here to be instructed, have I? By two old maids,
too, who have never had any encouragement that <i>I</i>
know of to change their state! This is what I get by
coming out of my way to wish you joy on your <i>birthday</i>!
a precious day it is! so <i>important</i> to everybody!
One sure thing, you&#39;ve had <i>enough</i> of &#39;em, te hee! I
guess my run-in will be a run-off, though you <i>are</i> so
pleasant and hospitable, I&#39;m sure!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Do not darken these doors again!&quot; said Miss Pearl.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page284" id="page284"></a>[pg&nbsp;284]</span>
&quot;Do not speak to me in the street!&quot; said Miss Ruby.
&quot;The acquaintance is at an end!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I thank you for the favor!&quot; the visitor flung back
over her departing shoulder. &quot;Of course it&#39;s been a
<i>great privilege</i> to come traipsing out here to the other
end of nowhere, but it&#39;s one I <i>can</i> dispense with, if I
try hard; and as for <i>speaking</i> to two poor mildewed
little old maids that stick to their jobs like seaweed to
a rock, and that&#39;s kept there out of <i>pity</i>&mdash;out of
<i>pity</i>!&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The sound of the closing door checked her flow of
eloquence; she departed.</p>

<p class="indent">This is the true story of the quarrel between the
Misses Caddie, &quot;two ladies as highly respected in our
midst for their ability and discretion as beloved for
their many endearing social qualities,&quot; as Mr. Jordano
took occasion to say in the next <i>Centinel</i>, and
one who from this time on was commonly spoken of
as &quot;that <i>mean</i> Sophia Sharpe!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">But the deed was done. Before morning all Cyrus
knew that Kitty Ross was about to receive a visit from
an English Nobleman, and that: A, he expected to be
met by a coach and six horses, or, B, that his arrival
by such conveyance was to be anticipated.</p>

<p class="indent">Before considering the effect of this news upon
Cyrus, let us glance for a moment into Madam Flynt&#39;s
parlor on the evening of the day just past. Madam
Flynt was receiving a visitor; alone, Miss Croly having
gone for the quiet stroll which was her delight
on summer evenings. &quot;With Nature!&quot; the good lady
would explain. &quot;I love to stroll hand in hand with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page285" id="page285"></a>[pg&nbsp;285]</span>
Nature: so vast, yet so benignant, in her gentler aspects.&quot;
She recited poetry as she strolled, finding
it most beneficial.</p>

<p class="indent">Madam Flynt&#39;s visitor stood by the door, declining
a proffered seat; an apron thrown over her head announced
in some subtle way that her visit was one of
urgency; she spoke in low, emphatic tones.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No&#39;m! no! she wasn&#39;t feverish that I could see; I
couldn&#39;t feel her pult, but her skin felt natural. She
acted more like she was out of her mind. I thought
I&#39;d step over!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You were quite right, Sarepta! Tell me again
just how it was, will you? I didn&#39;t quite take it in
the first time.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Evidently nothing loth, Sarepta spoke as follows:</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It was five o&#39;clock, or thereabouts. She had just
come in from the stable; she feeds too much sugar to
them hosses, and so I tell John Tucker, but of course
he knew all about hosses before they was created.
The telephone rang and she went. It was Ruby Caddie&#39;s
voice. I could tell by the cackle; she sounds for
all the world like our Black Spanish hen; of course I
couldn&#39;t hear what she said. &#39;Yes,&#39; says Kitty. &#39;Yes,
quite clear! Yes, I understand entirely.&#39; Then I
judge Ruby asked her to repeat the message, for she
says, kind o&#39; singin&#39; it, Madam Flynt, the way I never
heard her speak before since she <i>could</i> speak: &#39;<i>Comin&#39;,
coach and six. Duke!</i>&#39;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well: Kitty covered her face with her two hands
and stood there a spell: if you&#39;ll excuse me mentionin&#39;
it, as if she was <i>prayin&#39;</i>! Then she hung up, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page286" id="page286"></a>[pg&nbsp;286]</span>
swung round, and see me standin&#39; there. I had no
idea of listenin&#39; you understand, Madam Flynt. I
would scorn the action. I was just passin&#39; through
the hall, and the sound of her voice&mdash;well, it was so
<i>peculiar</i>, I just stopped in my steps. First of it when
she looked up, she was white as my apurn: then, all in
a flash, the child&#39;s face was like she was afire, so to
express it; her eyes were shinin&#39;, and her cheeks&mdash;well,
there! I expected to hear the flames cracklin&#39;.
She rushes up to me and takes my two hands. &#39;Dance,
Sarepta!&#39; she says, wild as a hawk. &#39;Dance! you
<i>must</i> dance!&#39; and she drags me up and down that hall&mdash;you
know the stren&#39;th of her wrists, drivin&#39; like she
does&mdash;till the breath was out of my body; and all the
time she was singin&#39;, a crazy kind of jig tune she&#39;s
ben singin&#39; about the house this two weeks past till I
thought I should <i>fly</i>. &#39;Do for the land&#39;s sake,&#39; I&#39;d
say, &#39;sing something that has some <i>sense</i> to it!&#39; It
don&#39;t begin nor end anywhere, goes round and round
like a cat&#39;s cradle&mdash;well, it&#39;s crazy, that&#39;s all there is
to it! She sang and danced till <i>her</i> breath gave out;
I was past speech or cry by that time. Then she
throws her arms round me and hugs me till&mdash;well, I
<i>hadn&#39;t</i> any breath, but if I had, I wouldn&#39;t of, if you
understand what I mean: and then off she flings out
the back door, and I heard her routin&#39; round in the
stable, and next thing out she comes with Pilot in the
light wagon and off they go down the ro&#39;d like Job&#39;s
cat after a fish. That was two hours ago, and she
ain&#39;t come back yet. I thought I&#39;d step over&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Where is John Tucker?&quot; asked Madam Flynt.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page287" id="page287"></a>[pg&nbsp;287]</span>
&quot;Home sick, with the rheumatism. If he&#39;d ben
there, I don&#39;t know as I need to have troubled you; not
that he has much sense, but still he has <i>some</i>. Hark!
there! I do believe&mdash;yes&#39;m, there she is; just turnin&#39;
into the yard. Thanks be! I must hasten back.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You are a good soul, Sarepta Darwin!&quot; Madam
Flynt spoke with feeling. &quot;You were very right to
come over. Get Kitty to come in and see me in the
morning, will you? Make some errand, so she won&#39;t
know&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes&#39;m, I will! I&#39;ll borry an egg or something;
thank <i>you</i>, Madam Flynt! Good-night!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Kitty, dancing into the kitchen half an hour later,
found a grim figure sitting bolt upright, reading a religious
paper of austere appearance. Her gay &quot;Supper,
please, Sarepta!&quot; was rewarded with the information
that there was no supper that Sarepta knew
of. Supper was at six o&#39;clock; if folks were here,
they&#39;d get it; if they preferred to get their victuals
elsewhere, it was no concern of hers that she knew
of. Kitty opened wide eyes.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh! Excuse me for living!&quot; she said. &quot;Am I so
<i>very</i> late? The moonlight is so heavenly, Sarepta, I
think I was very good to come in at all; and of course
I had to see to those Lambs before I had my own
supper. John Tucker wanted to send Timmy over,
but I wouldn&#39;t let him; I love to put them to bed once
in a while. But no matter, Sarepta. I&#39;ll find a
doughnut and some milk; don&#39;t bother. I&#39;m not really
hungry!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page288" id="page288"></a>[pg&nbsp;288]</span>
Kitty&#39;s hand was on the buttery door when Sarepta
intervened with a truly awful aspect.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;When you wish me to go, Kitty Ross, you can say
so and I will. While I stay, I calc&#39;late to attend to
things in this kitchen. You go into the sittin&#39;-room
and I&#39;ll bring you a tray.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The tray, when brought, displayed a most tempting
little meal: creamed chicken, buttered scones, cocoa
and strawberry jam; but for once Kitty seemed hardly
conscious of the good things. She looked up as if in
a dream, her eyes soft and dewy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Are you very cross, Sarepta?&quot; she asked. &quot;I&#39;m
sorry I was late.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Humph!&quot; Sarepta apparently extremely cross, and
busy setting down the tray.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t you love me?&quot; asked the girl, as she had
been used to ask when she was six and wanted an extra
cooky. No answer being returned, Kitty came out of
her dream, her own alert, thoughtful self; looked and
saw the grim lips quivering, the workworn hands trembling
as they hovered about the tray.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Sarepta!&quot; Kitty sprang up, threw her arms round
the neck of her faithful friend, and whispered three
words in her ear.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;So you see!&quot; she said.</p>

<p class="indent">Sarepta Darwin threw her apron over her head and
departed, to hurry up to her room and lock her door.
For this time, Sarepta <i>was</i> crying, and no one must
ever know it. The idea!</p>

<p class="h2">CHAPTER XXI<br />
<span class="smcap">the tribulations of cyrus</span></p>

<p class="indent">The matter came up at Bygoods&#39;, next morning,
and was discussed with due gravity and decorum:
present, Miss Almeria behind the counter,
Messrs. Mallow and Jordano in front of it; Mr.
Bygood in his wheel-chair, enjoying a little Society in
the front shop, before retiring to the slumbrous calm
of the back. To these were soon added the Messrs.
Jebus, who had been alarmed by a sudden incursion of
Sharpes the night before, heralding the proximate
over-running of Cyrus by dissolute nobles &quot;cracking
their whips round our ears and driving their wheels
<i>over our bodies</i> if something isn&#39;t done about it!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Josiah, in anxious squeaks, wanted to know
what all this <i>meant</i>; hey? He was all upset; he didn&#39;t
know as he could match his silks, this kind of thing
going on; his hand fairly shook. They claimed Ruby
Caddie had taken to her bed: was that so?</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;It is so!&quot; Miss Almeria inclined her head gravely.
&quot;Ruby is quite prostrated. My sister is with her,
Pearl, of course, being unable to leave the Bank. It
is very unfortunate, Mr. Jebus. The sanctity of the
Office has been violated, you see, and Ruby feels it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page290" id="page290"></a>[pg&nbsp;290]</span>
keenly. It was not in any way her fault: an unpardonable
indiscretion&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;What I say is,&quot; Mr. Mallow broke in,&mdash;&quot;excuse
me for interruptin&#39;, Miss Bygood; what I say is, that
woman ought to be taken and <i>ducked</i>, sir! ducked in
the hoss-pond for a common cormorant! She is a
dirigo, that&#39;s what she is! a dirigo, sir!&quot; (Mr. Mallow
meant termagant and virago, but it did not matter;
everybody understood.)</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Doubtless! doubtless!&quot; Mr. Jordano waved his
note-book anxiously. &quot;Most ill-judged! most unfortunate-tate-tate!
But as to the&mdash;if I may borrow a
legal expression, the <i>corpus delicti</i>; as to the alleged
message itself. Is that, does Miss Bygood consider,
correctly reported? No indiscreeto, I beg to assure
you! But if it <i>has</i> been made public&mdash;there seem to
be two reports current, which in a measure conflict-tict-tict.
Is it permissible to ask which is the correct&mdash;a&mdash;version?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Almeria pondered a moment, conscious that
all eyes were fixed eagerly upon her.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;As the message <i>has</i> been made public,&quot; she said
at last, &quot;though feloniously so, feloniously so, I must
consider&mdash;&mdash;&quot; she bowed to a general murmur of assent
from the company&mdash;&quot;it is perhaps best to be sure
that it is correctly given. The words of the message
were these: &#39;<i>Coming; coach and six: Duke</i>.&#39; So
much our friend, Miss Caddie, admits. As to the
precise meaning of the message, she declines to express
an opinion; very properly, in my judgment.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, quite so! quite so!&quot; murmured Mr. Jordano.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page291" id="page291"></a>[pg&nbsp;291]</span>
&quot;Very discreeto, I am sure. Hers not to reason why,
hers but to do and&mdash;which we sincerely hope that
estimable lady will refrain from&mdash;&quot; Mr. Jordano became
involved, and flourished the note-book nervously.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Question is, what in hemp does it <i>mean</i>?&quot; broke
in Mr. Mallow again. &quot;I beg you&#39;ll excuse me, Miss
Bygood; that darned tattle-tale has got me all worked
up; but I want to get to the bottom of this. Does it
mean that the feller is <i>comin</i>&#39; that way, drivin&#39; six
hosses&mdash;three pair, that would be, I presume&mdash;he
wouldn&#39;t drive that number tantrum, most likely&mdash;because
if it does, I&#39;d have to get extry help, you see,
Miss Almery. Or would he bring his own help with
him, think? A Dook is next to a king, isn&#39;t he? Did
you ever see a Dook, Mr. Bygood?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Bygood, as was well known, had made several
voyages in his early manhood, in the mystic character
of ship&#39;s husband, and had visited Foreign Parts.
All eyes turned on the old gentleman, who beamed
gently through his spectacles. No, he had never seen
a duke; that is, never in life, sir! He had seen the
statue of the Duke of Wellington, in Hyde Park,
London, England; it was considered very fine, he believed:
very fine. A work of art, sir!</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Jason Jebus, whose contribution to the conversation
had been hitherto a running commentary of
squeaks, now became articulate.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I was in to Abram Hanks&#39;s just now to get me
some lahstic for my boots&mdash;&quot; (have I said that the
partners wore elastic-sided Congress boots? They
did; the difference between right and left was less
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page292" id="page292"></a>[pg&nbsp;292]</span>
obvious in these than in other boots, and Mr. Jason
always wore out Mr. Josiah&#39;s left boots, which did
not fit the club foot)&mdash;&quot;and <i>he</i>claimed the&mdash;individual&mdash;was
comin&#39; by rail, and wanted some one should
meet him at the deepo with a coach and six horses.
Cissy Sharpe told him, he said.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Good reason for believin&#39; &#39;tain&#39;t so!&quot; snorted Mr.
Mallow.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Abram didn&#39;t let on he felt anyways sure of it,&quot;
Mr. Jason continued. &quot;He thought mebbe he&#39;d dress
up his window a mite on the chance&mdash;strangers, you
know&mdash;and I didn&#39;t know but what I would. Like
to have &#39;em see a tasty window, if they <i>should</i> come.
Like to have Cyrus stores make as good appearance
as any. Josiah has a handsome centrepiece just
com&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now! now!&quot; Mr. Josiah put in testily. &quot;Don&#39;t
you go runnin&#39; away with no notions, Jason! I ain&#39;t
said I was willin&#39; to put that piece in the winder, and
I don&#39;t know as I am. There&#39;s consid&#39;able blue in it,
and blue won&#39;t stand a winder light, it perishes right
out. Come on! we must be goin&#39;. Give you good
mornin&#39;, neighbors!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Josiah stumped off, Mr. Jason twittering at his
heels. Mr. Mallow looked after them with a tolerant
smile.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Now Jason will put in the day,&quot; he said, &quot;publishin&#39;
up that winder. Start him and Abram Hanks, and
we shall have the whole Street dandied up like Decoration
Day. I guess the Mallow House will stay pretty
much as it is, Dook or no Dook.&quot; (Oh, Mr. Mallow!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page293" id="page293"></a>[pg&nbsp;293]</span>
Mr. Mallow! as if Hannah Sullivan were not at work
at this moment &quot;cleaning&quot; your spotless paint, while
Billy polishes the shining silver!) &quot;I guess what suits
the Boarders&#39;ll do for him, what say?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Indeed, yes, Mr. Mallow!&quot; Miss Almeria cast a
kind glance on &quot;the Mine Host.&quot; &quot;The Mallow House
is always the perfection of order and taste. You
would put him in the Bird of Paradise Room, I presume?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Yes&#39;m; that is, I think so!&quot; Mr. Mallow&#39;s brow
was thoughtful. &quot;It&#39;s the largest room, and the handsomest,
most think. Me and Billy was lookin&#39; things
over this mornin&#39;. He didn&#39;t know but the Castle
Room would be the most suitable;&quot; (the Mallow
House rooms were named from the patterns of their
wall-paper) &quot;you know I put a <i>re</i>source in there last
fall, kind o&#39; balcove like, and he thought set the bed
inside that, &#39;twould have the look of two rooms; but
I don&#39;t know! Nor I don&#39;t know as we&#39;ve got this
matter rightly settled,&quot; he added with a laugh, &quot;which
way this feller is comin&#39;, if he <i>is</i> comin&#39;. It may be
all folderido, some fool kid monkeyin&#39; with the telegraph,
thinkin&#39; he&#39;s all-fired smart. How &#39;bout that,
Very?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Jordano, on reflection, thought that improbable.
The message was not such as a boy would be likely to
invent: besides, the distance&mdash;he understood California
was the source&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">At this point Mr. Bygood, who had been dozing in
his chair, looked up. &quot;What does Kitty say?&quot; he
asked calmly.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page294" id="page294"></a>[pg&nbsp;294]</span>
The others looked at each other.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dear Father,&quot; said Miss Almeria gently; &quot;under
all the circumstances, it would be hardly suitable, I
fear, to&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Mallow colored high and cleared his throat
nervously. &quot;That&#39;s right!&quot; he said. &quot;That&#39;s right,
Miss Bygood. I&mdash;I met Kitty this mornin&#39;, on my
way down: I forgot to mention it. I didn&#39;t <i>say</i> anything,
you understand: I only just threw it off, jokin&#39;
like. &#39;Well, Kitty,&#39; I says. &#39;How&#39;s the British this
mornin&#39;?&#39; She looks at me, Doctor all over; astonishin&#39;
the way she&#39;ll call him up sometimes. &#39;Pretty
well, Mr. Mallow,&#39; she says. &#39;As well as can be expected
after Bunker Hill,&#39; she says. We shan&#39;t get
anything out of Kitty.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It was finally decided, Miss Almeria voicing the
general opinion, that the less said about the momentous
telegram the better. The dignity of Cyrus would
be compromised by taking any notice of tidings received
in a manner &quot;equally irregular and reprehensible.&quot;
Miss Almeria bent her handsome head at its
severest angle.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I am confident, dear friends,&quot; she concluded, &quot;that
silence is the only&mdash;shall I say attitude?&mdash;worthy of
Cyrus in this emergency.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, quite so! quite so!&quot; murmured Mr. Jordano
with forlorn nobility. &quot;You point us the skyward
way, Miss Almeria, as ever!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s right!&quot; said Mr. Mallow. &quot;Silence and
Cyrus: both begin with C. Guess we can get along,
even if he don&#39;t come at all, what say? Shall we toddle,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page295" id="page295"></a>[pg&nbsp;295]</span>
Very? Good mornin&#39;, Mr. Bygood! mornin&#39;,
Miss Bygood, and thank you kindly!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">John Tucker was perhaps the only person in Cyrus
who knew nothing of the fateful telegram. He was
having a suffering time, poor John, with rheumatism.
He had struggled valiantly against it through the long
winter and the perilous combination of extremes that
we call spring in New England. He had managed to
keep the knowledge of his ailment from Kitty, and
had gone to the station in all weathers, steadfastly
refusing to allow her to meet &quot;them pesky trains.&quot;
Now, however, when &quot;the season of snows and sins&quot;
was over, and summer was here with her lap full of
roses, the enemy clutched John Tucker in an iron
grip and held him fast. He struggled out every day,
and crept over to Ross House, where he sat, in stable
or harness room, directing his son Tim, who did his
fourteen-year-old best, but found &quot;Pa&quot; hard to satisfy.
Tim felt fully equal to driving Old Crummles, or even
Dan, to meet the trains, but was bidden briefly to &quot;shut
up&quot; when he volunteered to do so. Kitty was all
eagerness to drive herself, but John&#39;s face of misery
at the suggestion smote her heart, and she engaged
Amos Barrell, the blacksmith&#39;s stalwart son, to perform
this duty, and to help in the stable when more
help was needed. Amos was usually a silent youth,
with little more to say than &quot;Yep&quot; and &quot;Nope&quot; and
&quot;That so?&quot; but about this time he became conversational,
not to say inquisitive. He wanted to know if
they was any coaches in town. What was that big
wagon there all kivered up? Was that a coach?
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page296" id="page296"></a>[pg&nbsp;296]</span>
Warn&#39;t? Well, he didn&#39;t hardly think&mdash;some said
there was a coach in the stable out to Gaylords&#39;. Was
it sold, think, or was it there yet? Gramp said there
used to be one to the Maller House when he was a
boy, but he never heard of their puttin&#39; more&#39;n four
hosses to it, Gramp said. Gramp allowed mebbe&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Shut up!&quot; said John Tucker. &quot;Know what that
means?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Visitors came to the harness room, as usual; more
than usual, in fact. John Tucker, his bones like red-hot
iron within him, thought they came like grasshoppers
in a hayfield. Orison Wesley sidled in, lank
and lantern-jawed; sat upon a keg and sympathized
with John&#39;s sufferings. He knew what &#39;twas; ketched
you in the small of your back&mdash;gorry! he guessed he&#39;d
used a case of Carter&#39;s Chlorodyne Liniment last winter.
The woman just slabbed it on; slabbed it on,
sir. That was right; you wanted something that
s&#39;arched your vitals.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How many hosses you drivin&#39; now, Tucker?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I ain&#39;t drivin&#39; none!&quot; growled John, one eye on
the clock.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s right! but I mean when you have your
health? Lemme see! You&#39;ve got three here, ain&#39;t
you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">John grunted assent.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Drive &#39;em single mostly, do ye? Ever hitch &#39;em
up together?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">What ye mean? Three hosses together? No!
did ever you go up to the Asylum? Well, I wouldn&#39;t
if I was you; they mightn&#39;t let you out again.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page297" id="page297"></a>[pg&nbsp;297]</span>
Mr. Wesley swayed to and fro on the keg, chuckling
slowly. He could make allowances for a man&#39;s
being a mite crotchetty with the rheumatiz. Besides,
he had not got the information he sought.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ever drive more than three?&quot; he droned on.
&quot;Ever drive six hosses, Tucker?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">John Tucker rose slowly and painfully, creaking in
every joint.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I&#39;ve drove six jackasses,&quot; he said. &quot;I drove &#39;em
out of this stable. S&#39;pose you foller &#39;em, Orison, and
see where they&#39;ve got to by this time! I&#39;m goin&#39; home
to supper.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">At the &quot;Chantery,&quot; great excitement prevailed. The
girls were all a-twitter, speculating on the probable
age of the expected nobleman, his appearance&mdash;(&quot;He
ought to be dark, of course, to contrast; and dark is
so much more aristo&mdash;&mdash;.&quot; &quot;My <i>dear</i>! how absurd!
every duke I ever <i>read</i> of was pure Saxon, with blue
or gray eyes and fair hair swept back from a marble&mdash;&quot;)&mdash;the
the probable date of his advent.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My <i>dear</i>! he may be here to-morrow; just <i>think</i>!
what <i>shall</i> we say to him? Will he expect us to
curtsey, do you suppose?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Thus Zephine, the least sensible of the girls.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Well, we won&#39;t!&quot; said Nelly stoutly. Nelly was
engaged to Joe Myers now, and was not afraid of all
the Dukes in creation. &quot;I&#39;ll tell you what, girls! Kitty
is coming to supper to-night: I asked her this morning.
Mother, you said there would be plenty, didn&#39;t you?
We&#39;ll ask her right out. I&#39;m sure we know her well
enough!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page298" id="page298"></a>[pg&nbsp;298]</span>
&quot;Ask what?&quot; Mr. Chanter spoke abruptly, looking
up from his <i>Congregationalist</i>. That was the most
singular thing about Pa; you never could tell when
he wouldn&#39;t hear, though generally you might discuss
the most thrilling events in the (Cyrus) world without
his taking the slightest notice.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ask what?&quot; repeated the Reverend Timothy.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Lor, Pa! how you startled us! Ask Kitty about
this duke, or whatever he is, who is coming to see her.
She is coming to supper to-night, and Nelly is going
to ask her all about him, right straight out, and about
the coach and six, and all.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Nelly will do nothing of the sort.&quot; Mr. Chanter
spoke with calm decision. &quot;Kitty knows her own affairs;
if she has anything to tell us, she will; if not,
it is none of our business.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Quite right!&quot; nodded Mrs. Chanter over her basket.
&quot;Suppose we finish the stockings, girls! you
will each want a whole pair to receive the Duke in, you
know; perhaps Pa will read us a chapter of &#39;Pickwick&#39;
while we work.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">What was to be done with parents like these? &quot;Wax
nine times out of ten,&quot; whispered Zephine to Lina,
&quot;and the tenth time cast iron with a twinkle!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Kitty came to supper, looking so lovely that even
these friends, who knew and loved her beauty so well,
marveled at it. The girls worshiped openly; Rodney
and Aristides heaved furtive sighs and cast shy
glances over their cocoa-cups. The elders noticed with
silent joy that a little pallor, a little drawn look about
the sweet mouth, a little dark line under the eyes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page299" id="page299"></a>[pg&nbsp;299]</span>
that had troubled their kind hearts, was gone from
the girl&#39;s face. She bloomed like one of her own June
roses; her eyes shot gay sparkles; her laughter sounded
every note of joyous mirth&mdash;but alas! for the girls!
she said no word of dukes or coaches. At parting
she kissed Mrs. Chanter with special warmth, and
lingered a moment at the door looking at her host with
shining eyes. &quot;Would you mind if I kissed you, too?&quot;
she asked: and Mr. Chanter went back to his books
with blurred spectacles and a lump in his throat. But
Kitty made Rodney, her proud escort, race her all the
way home, and honestly, he had no idea a girl could
sprint like that.</p>

<p class="indent">Madam Flynt? That lady kept her own counsel
in these days. She refused a visit from Mrs. Sharpe,
sending word that she was specially engaged. So
she was, up in her room, looking over her jewel-case,
selecting certain emeralds, and being very short
with Miss Croly, who deemed it her duty to touch
lightly on the unwisdom (she did not say folly: the
word would be discourteous!) of persons in later life
wearing other than the simpler forms of jewelry. A
chaste gold brooch, now&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">It was intimated that when the lady&#39;s opinion was
desired it would be asked for, and the friends parted&mdash;for
half an hour.</p>

<p class="indent">Mrs. Sharpe, failing of entrance at Madam Flynt&#39;s,
rang at the door of Ross House; continued to ring at
intervals, for fifteen minutes, Kitty being out; finally
went round to the back door and knocked. The door
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page300" id="page300"></a>[pg&nbsp;300]</span>
was opened three inches by Sarepta, a figure of granite.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, how do you do, Sarepta?&quot; thus Mrs. Sharpe
in honeyed tones. &quot;I think the front door bell must
be out of order. I&#39;ve been ringing and ringing! Kitty
at home?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Kitty out: not likely to return before night. Sarepta
attempted to close the door, but the visitor slipped an
adroit foot into the opening.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;How well you&#39;re looking, Sarepta! I declare I
think I must come in and make <i>you</i> a little visit, he!
he!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">She tried to push the door, wider, but it was held in
an iron grip; Sarepta, apparently, had not heard her
remark.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ahem!&quot; Mrs. Sharpe tried a new tack. &quot;Expecting
visitors, are you, Sarepta?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Not as I know of!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oh, I understand! <i>a</i> visitor, I should have said.
It&#39;s always well to be exact. Well, all I called for was
to say, if you wanted to <i>borrow</i> anything, silver or
the like of that, I hope you&#39;ll come to me, Sarepta.
Mr. Sharpe was part English, you know; his grandfather
came from the Provinces, and of course I&#39;m
acquainted with English ways. Perhaps I&#39;d better
come in and talk it over&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Excuse me! <i>My bread is in the oven!</i>&quot; said
Sarepta Darwin.</p>

<p class="indent">The door closed on a shriek.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I scrouged her toe <i>good</i>!&quot; Sarepta told Madam
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page301" id="page301"></a>[pg&nbsp;301]</span>
Flynt that night. &quot;She bellered right out, and I was
glad.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Perhaps the most complete summing up of the situation
was given that evening by Miss Almeria Bygood
as she sat with her sister over nine o&#39;clock supper,
that pleasant meal that still lingers in blessed Cyrus,
where we dine at half-past twelve and sup at five or
six. Molly had brought in the tray and drawn up
the little round table between the two ladies as they
sat with their feet on the embroidered fender-stool.
(There was no fire, but they always sat there in the
evening.) Pretty Molly, crisp and trim in her light
print dress! Miss Bygoods did not hold with putting
maids in black, especially young maids. &quot;Why should
they be made to ape the semblance of sorrow?&quot; Miss
Almeria asked with dignity. &quot;We trust our service is
not so arduous as to cause them the reality!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">They were talking of the duke, of course, over their
cocoa and sponge drops: who, save Kitty and John
Tucker, talked of anything else in this week of the
Tribulations of Cyrus? They wondered, hoped,
feared, wondered again. Would they lose their Kitty,
the rose and jewel of their little world? Would this
great nobleman carry her off, if not on his horse
(Miss Egeria knew nothing of strong men from the
north!) at least in his coach and six? Thus Miss
Egeria, trembling, romantic.</p>

<p class="indent">Surely not, Miss Almeria replied gravely. A sense
of propriety would assuredly not be wanting in a person
of such lofty position. At the same time, it was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page302" id="page302"></a>[pg&nbsp;302]</span>
most unfortunate that Johanna and Edward were absent.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Most unfortunate!&quot; Miss Egeria sighed. &quot;Not
only for the&mdash;the suitability of it, of course, in every
way, but&mdash;well, Sister, Johanna has such an air, such
knowledge of the world; and Edward is such an elegant
man! I am sure the duke would not anywhere
meet finer manners, and we would wish him to see
Cyrus at its best!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Dear Sister!&quot; Miss Almeria laid her slender hand,
with its antique but costly rings, gently on Miss
Egeria&#39;s cashmere sleeve; &quot;have no fears on <i>that</i>
score! there at least, if nowhere else, we may feel
secure. In matters of courtesy and breeding&mdash;with
one or two exceptions&mdash;&mdash;&quot; Miss Almeria closed her
eyes; &quot;Cyrus is <i>always</i> at its best!&quot;</p>

<p class="h2">CHAPTER XXII<br />
<span class="smcap">the duke of lee</span></p>

<p class="indent">During the week that followed Cyrus was
deeply impressed by the importance of fresh
air and exercise. It walked abroad, at all
hours of the day. Young Cyrus scoured the six roads
that centred in the happy village, hung over fences,
scanning the countryside, loitered about the station
at train time. Mature Cyrus was genteelly busy in
its front garden, tying up rose-bushes and removing
(in gloves!) rose-beetles. Young and old alike found
much business to be done in the Street. Abram Hanks
drove a brisk trade in spools of thread and other small
wares. Now and then something unusual was asked
for, as when Nelly Chanter wanted some white mull,
for a purpose unspecified.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, I ain&#39;t got any!&quot; Mr. Hanks&#39;s tone expressed
injury. &quot;I had some, but them folks that was at the
hotel last summer bought it all out on me!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">There was a positive run on Cheeseman&#39;s candy
store; Uncle Ivory was almost annoyed by it. &quot;Look
at here, Sty!&quot; he said one morning. &quot;&#39;Pears to me
you&#39;ve eat all the toffee that&#39;s likely to agree with you
real good. That pan was full yesterday, and now
look at it! I can&#39;t make it every day, you know.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page304" id="page304"></a>[pg&nbsp;304]</span>
You ask the girls to make you up a pan of molasses
at home, if you have to <i>have</i> any more!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Aristides Chanter did feel that he needed special
sustenance in the way of sweets. He knew, in his sixteen-year-old
heart, that no one loved Kitty as he did;
and now that Bobby was engaged to Melissa&mdash;well,
Rod was only two years older; he didn&#39;t see but he
had full as good a right&mdash;and anyhow, Rod was at
college, and if this fellow was coming, Kitty&#39;s friends
ought to be on the lookout for him; he might be an
impostor, like the Ducal Decoy in that bloodhound
yarn. Anyhow, it was awful poky hanging about the
station, waiting for every train. Pa wouldn&#39;t let a
fellow smoke, and a fellow must do <i>something</i>!</p>

<p class="indent">There was one person who haunted the station even
more persistently than Aristides; this was Wilson Wibird.
Wilson had become a rather deplorable figure
in these days. He had resented bitterly Kitty&#39;s treatment
of him on the occasion described in a previous
chapter; he had also been badly frightened. Mr. Jordano
might be a thought fantastic in certain aspects,
but he was not a man to be trifled with; the stern
admonition with which he had dismissed Wilson that
day still rang in the ears of the rejected lover.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Keep out of that lady&#39;s way-tay-tay, or it will be
the worse for you-too-too!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Wilson cowered under &quot;Italio&#39;s&quot; fiery glance, and
slunk away, muttering curses that he dared not breathe
aloud.</p>

<p class="indent">Uncle Marshall had been equally severe, on hearing
from his friend of the occurrence. He told his nephew
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page305" id="page305"></a>[pg&nbsp;305]</span>
plainly that if ever he heard of his pestering Kitty
Ross again he would not only discharge him on the
spot, but would flounce (trounce) him till he
couldn&#39;t tell whether he was a bluenette or a blondin.</p>

<p class="indent">Nor were these threats the only ones that rankled
in Wilson&#39;s mind. Bobby Chanter, now one of the
family, disapproved entirely of his manners and customs
in the bosom of that family, especially of his
bearing toward his sister. Kind soul that Bobby was,
he would not make trouble for poor Mrs. Wibird: he
knew what mothers were; his blue eyes softened at
the thought. He merely intimated to Wilson &quot;on the
quiet&quot; that from now on he, Wilson, would be civil
and pleasant-spoken to Melissa, and would bring in
coal and kindling wood for his mother, or he, Bobby,
would know the reason why.</p>

<p class="indent">Smarting under these manifold injuries, Wilson
sought consolation where&mdash;alas! he was in the habit
of seeking it; but the cupboard bottle held no exhilaration
for him nowadays. He grew more and
more sullen, more and more morose, brooding over
his wrongs. With limpet tenacity&mdash;I beg his pardon!
with Iron Will&mdash;he still clung to the idea of
marriage with Kitty, of the mastership of Ross
House; but now he conjured up lurid pictures of the
methods by which the conquest was to be obtained.
His path might lie through Blood!</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I would wade through seas of it to conquer you,
proud woman!&quot; he hissed through his teeth, scowling
desperately at the mirror. He thought he looked
rather like Lucifer. He saw his uncle and that &quot;dastard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page306" id="page306"></a>[pg&nbsp;306]</span>
scribbler,&quot; as he mentally termed Mr. Jordano,
lying with faces turned to the sky, a ghastly wound
in their temples, from which the life blood welled. As
for Billy&mdash;Wilson ground his teeth. Billy had &quot;held
him up&quot; only that morning: held him by the collar
with one hand and searched him with the other, confiscating
the pocket-lurking bottle, and dismissing
him with a friendly kick and &quot;Better look out! better
give up! goin&#39; to the dogs, and no decent pup would
look at you!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The news of the expected advent of the &quot;Duke,&quot;
coming like a thunderclap, caused Wilson&#39;s cup of bitterness
to overflow. On hearing it (Lissy came in
full of the tidings. Wasn&#39;t it wonderful? Kitty deserved
<i>everything</i>, of course, though Lissy understood
the Aristocracy was commonly small and plain-looking.
She didn&#39;t believe he would wear a coronet outside
his hat, like they said; the idea!), Wilson retired to
his room and locked the door. He would have double-locked
it, as they did in stories, but did not know how.</p>

<p class="indent">This was the end! he intimated to the mirror. To
live defeated, disgraced, robbed of his rights, or to
pass in blood and flame, <i>perchance not alone</i>! He
summoned up the scene. The train dashing into the
station (Wilson leaned to the theory of arrival by
train), the proud scion of an effete aristocracy alighting
to find John Tucker perched on top of a &quot;Tally
Ho&quot; with six spanking thoroughbreds tossing their
heads and champing the bit. A fair, false face looks
out of the coach window; a white, traitress hand
waves. At that instant a slender Form springs forward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page307" id="page307"></a>[pg&nbsp;307]</span>
with gesture of command. &quot;Stay! one word&mdash;the
last! Katrine, farewell! I go, but <i>not alone</i>!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Two shots ring out. A shriek, a puff of smoke:
two forms lie side by side, on the platform, and an
agonizing woman flings herself on the bleeding breast
of the last Wilson Wimberley Wibird&mdash;<i>too late!</i></p>

<p class="indent">It sounds ludicrous: it was tragic. Weak minds
can be desperate as well as strong ones, and poor Wilson,
between drink and diseased vanity, was very near
the edge of mania. So he hung about the station at
every train hour; haggard, sodden, miserable; and
really, the wonder is that no tragedy came of it. One
might so easily have come, had it not been for that
blessed rain.</p>

<p class="indent">The farmers had been saying for a month that what
we wanted now was a nice warm rain. We got it, at
the end of this week. It rained, and rained, and
rained; one day, two days, three days. Not in showers
or spurts, but in a steady, even downpour, without
haste and without rest. For the first day, Cyrus
held out bravely, tied up its roses and sped on its
errands in waterproof and umbrella, hung about the
station in mackintosh and rubber boots. The second
day, the elders stayed indoors, looking anxiously out
of window, listening eagerly for sound of hoofs or
wheels; only young Cyrus patrolled the Street, and
hung about the station. By evening of the third day,
pretty much everybody had abandoned the Quest of
the Duke, collective Cyrus expressing the opinion that
no duke that ever was hatched was worth spoiling all
your clothes and getting pneumonia for. It was on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page308" id="page308"></a>[pg&nbsp;308]</span>
evening of this third day that John Tucker gave up
and took to his bed, his rheumatism taking an inflammatory
turn. Kitty, alarmed at his condition, sent
Amos Barrell off to Tinkham for Dr. Pettijohn, with
rash orders not to come back without him. Amos
found the doctor out of town, not to return till nine
o&#39;clock; obeyed orders, bestowed Dan in the livery-stable,
and went to the &quot;Movies.&quot; Briefly, when the
8:30 train was due, it was Kitty and Pilot who met it.</p>

<hr />

<p class="indent">Number 47 was an express train, the pride of the
Road; it was making its usual speed, and confidently
expected to arrive &quot;on the dot&quot; at Cyrus and every
other station on the line; nevertheless, to one passenger
on board, Number 47 seemed the very limit of
slowness. The tall broad-shouldered young man who
sat in the furthest seat forward, elbows on knees, chin
in hands, was deep in thought through most of the
journey, but as eight o&#39;clock drew near he waxed impatient.
Call this an express train? If he ever let an
accommodation&mdash;or a freight for that matter&mdash;crawl
at this rate over any road <i>he</i> had anything to do with&mdash;good-night!
Stopping at every back yard! to pick
up the milk cans, he supposed! He fumed, looked at
his watch (front and back: the latter seemed to interest
him most, though the bright face that smiled
at him from a kodak print had little to say about time),
then plunged in thought again. Did she look like
that now? he wondered. Had she changed much in
these three years? Three years! it was a breath&mdash;it
was an eternity!</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page309" id="page309"></a>[pg&nbsp;309]</span>
&quot;<i>My soul! What if she&mdash;what if somebody
else</i>&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He sprang up as if something had stung him; recollected
himself, with a startled glance around him; met
the interested gaze of a Vassar freshman across the
aisle; sat down and with a shrug of his broad
shoulders settled into his reverie again. Nonsense!
that kind of girl&mdash;there was only one of the kind&mdash;wouldn&#39;t
forget in three years, nor in thirteen. That
last look she gave him, standing at the gate&mdash;he
paused, letting the thought of it curl warm about his
heart, sent the blood pulsing up into his ears. Beautiful
ears, the Vassar freshman thought; they were
all she could see now over his coat collar, except the
thick crop of hay-colored hair. Kitty used to say
that when the Cyrus hay-crop failed they could fall
back on Tom&#39;s hair, and then she would quote with
her own delicious twinkle, &quot;Good hay, sweet hay, hath
no fellow!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">If she had changed, Tom told himself severely, it
could only be for the better. She was a woman now,
his little girl: his little dancing gentlewoman of high
quality. He hummed a tune between his teeth; whistled
it; hummed it again. A quaint tune, with no
special beginning or ending. A gentleman in the seat
behind him became restive, shot irritated glances in
his direction; was on the point of remonstrating when
the tune ceased. The young man, glancing up, had
caught a glimpse of himself in a wall mirror. Talk
about change! what would Kitty say to him?</p>

<p class="indent">He stared straight into the wide-apart gray-blue
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page310" id="page310"></a>[pg&nbsp;310]</span>
eyes with their thick short lashes like a black fringe;
noted the three deep lines ruled straight across the
broad forehead; scrutinized the curious scar on the left
cheek. &quot;Well, you <i>are</i> a show!&quot; muttered Tom.</p>

<p class="indent">Of course he couldn&#39;t help the scar; well, he
couldn&#39;t help any of it, for that matter; but she might
like to know about the scar. They almost got him that
time! It was rum, that particular tribe taking a round
piece out of an enemy&#39;s cheek and stringing &#39;em on a
necklace to hang round the joss&#39;s neck. Gee! that was
a close shave! His eyes narrowed, seeing strange
things through their thick lashes. A camp in a mountain
pass, snowbound; food gone, water low. Lowering
faces of yellow men, huddled round a fire, casting
evil looks at the two, the white man and his faithful
&quot;boy,&quot; guarding the water skin. Then the rush, five
against two; the daggers gleaming, the wild cries, the
shots&mdash;how the echoes went battering back and forth
between the rock walls! then the shriek, the fall&mdash;Tom
shut his eyes, and drew a quick breath. He was a
kindly man. It was an ugly sight, that figure pitching
headlong over the edge, its yellow robes fluttering
back like the wings of some great swooping bird&mdash;bah!</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I <i>had</i> to kill him!&quot; said Tom. &quot;He almost got me,
and anyway we couldn&#39;t have managed but four. All
the same,&quot; he added, his eyes still on the bronzed face
in the glass, &quot;it is not precisely a ducal countenance
that will greet you, Kitty my dear. Will you mind
very much? You shall have the silks and satins all
right, little girl.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Oxcuse me, sair!</i>&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Tom started, and turned in his seat, to behold a
bearded and spectacled person of studious appearance,
quivering with some strong emotion.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I beg pardon?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The gentleman&#39;s aspect relaxed slightly: Tom&#39;s
speaking voice was of delightful quality, cordial and
musical.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Oxcuse me, sair!&quot; the bearded one repeated. &quot;I
am a musician!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Tom bowed slightly. &quot;Awfully jolly, I&#39;m sure!&quot;
he murmured. &quot;Must be an interesting profession.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Zat air zat you sing,&quot; the gentleman continued, &quot;it
is <i>nossing</i>: but nossing at all! it is no composeetion!
<i>ça m&#39;agace les nerfs, jusqu&#39; à la frénesie</i>&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Mille pardons, Monsieur!</i>&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Tom spoke excellent French. He was extremely
sorry to have offended a musical ear; he was humming
unconsciously. He explained that the air was an ancient
one: an old English folk-song and dance.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ah!&quot; the clouded brow cleared instantly. English!
that explained itself. A great nation, but unmusical.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page312" id="page312"></a>[pg&nbsp;312]</span>
Still, the song of the people, that revealed the heart;
he in return asked a thousand pardons. Let Monsieur,
he begged, continue to carol the artless chant of our
Saxon neighbor highly respected. He begged, he insisted.
Come, then! Let us hear the little air! it
might&mdash;who knew?&mdash;be arranged&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Tinkham!&quot; shouted the brakeman.</p>

<p class="indent">The musician rose precipitately. His station! he
was desolated to conclude an acquaintance so auspiciously
begun. He gave piano lessons in Tinkham!
His card: M. Anatole Beaulieu. <i>Peutêtre</i>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;<i>Au plaisir, Monsieur!</i>&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Tom sat down laughing. &quot;Five minutes more, and
we should have been swearing eternal friendship and
singing the &#39;Marseillaise.&#39; Nice little fellow! give me
the Caucasian every time! Only ten minutes now! I
wonder if she&#39;ll like&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Lee cast a surreptitious glance around him.
There were very few people in the car now, and nobody
was paying any attention to him. (The Vassar
freshman had got out, with a backward glance.) He
furtively drew from an inside pocket a small case, and
inspected its contents. It certainly was a good stone:
<i>vieille roche</i>, the Peking jeweler assured him, and he
believed it. The setting was good, too; he thought
she would like the setting. Of course nothing was
good enough for Kitty, but&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ticket, please!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Tom started, and looked up to meet the keen, quizzical
gaze of a pair of extremely intelligent brown
eyes.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page313" id="page313"></a>[pg&nbsp;313]</span>
&quot;Some ring!&quot; said the conductor. &quot;Likely to give
satisfaction, I should judge. Coming events cast
their shadows before, what? Getting out at Cyrus,
ain&#39;t you?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Blushing absurdly for such a big brown creature,
Tom handed over his ticket and pocketed the ring.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;I dare say you know how it is yourself!&quot; he said
with a half-laugh.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Bet your life! married mine last fall. Wish you&mdash;<i>suffering
Moses</i>! if this isn&#39;t Tom Lee, you may toast
and butter me and I won&#39;t say one word. Well, well,
well! you <i>are</i> a stranger! &#39;Member Bunty Jackson
over to Tupham? That&#39;s me!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Amid mutual greetings, friendly reminiscences,
laughter and chaff, the train drew into Cyrus station,
and Tom was bundled off, rather bewildered, with
&quot;Good luck, Tommy! see that you get her, and when
you&#39;ve <i>got</i> her&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent"><i>Exit</i> train: <i>manet</i> Thomas Lee, portmanteau in
hand, looking about him through a curtain of rain.</p>

<p class="indent">It was raining harder than it had all day; the rain
came sluicing down in torrents; it flowed like a stream
along the gleaming platform: it poured off the sou&#39;-wester
of the oil-skin clad figure standing with one
hand on the neck of a mighty good horse, Tom observed.
No Flanagan there! Flanagan must be dead.
&quot;Cab?&quot; he asked. The boy&mdash;looked like a boy: might
be anything, muffled like that: Flanagan&#39;s son, perhaps?&mdash;for
all reply opened the door of the carryall.
Tom was about to step in, when a man, appearing suddenly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page314" id="page314"></a>[pg&nbsp;314]</span>
from nowhere, jostled rudely against him, and
tried to thrust past him into the carriage.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Here!&quot; said Tom Lee. &quot;Get out, will you?
Where were you brought up?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">He had a glimpse of a white, furious face, that was
somehow familiar; of eyes glaring at him in what
looked like insane rage: what had he run into? Next
moment his nostrils dilated; he sniffed, inhaling a
pungent odor. Whiskey! That explained all.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Poor devil thinks he&#39;s struck the patrol wagon!&quot;
he laughed. &quot;Nothing like water to sober up on!&quot;
He put out his foot in a certain way he had learned
in Japan; the intruder staggered and fell with a loud
splash into the rain pool that had formed beside the
platform.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Drive on!&quot; said Tom Lee. &quot;He&#39;s all right! Dr.
Ross&#39;s, please!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">It was a silent drive. Tom, full of his own
thoughts, did not care to talk to Flanagan&#39;s boy or
any other boy; his thoughts flew ahead on bright
wings. Yet still his eyes took note through the dusk
of rain of familiar objects. The full moon was behind
the clouds, and mid-June evenings are never very
dark. Here was the Street, empty and silent: who
was night-watchman now, he wondered? What
pranks he and Bobby Chanter used to play on big Andy
Doolan! Bobby was a good sort. Tom hoped he was
here still Ah! was that Cheeseman&#39;s? &quot;Just wait,
Uncle Ivory! I&#39;ll be down to-morrow, sure pop!
What price molasses peppermints?&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Up the hill now; ah! there was the Common! Tom&#39;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page315" id="page315"></a>[pg&nbsp;315]</span>
heart was beating fast. Those lights, straight across,
were hers. Ah! here was his own house, dark and
shuttered. Poor mother! dearest mother! she would
be glad he was coming home, even if she was not here
to welcome him. She loved Kitty like her own daughter.
She knew the hope of his heart; it was her own,
too, she told him so the night before she went away.
The sweet Lady would be pleased, too: the lovely
dark-lily lady, his second mother. Everybody would
be pleased, he thought; if only Kitty herself could put
up with a brown, wrinkled, carved-up anatomy like
himself. &quot;Kitty! Kitty, do you hear? I am coming!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">The carriage stopped. The silent figure on the front
seat swung lightly to the ground: the door was opened.
A trembling voice spoke.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Will your Grace step out, or shall I bring a foot-stool?
Tom! <i>Tom! don&#39;t</i>! not in the street, my dear!
my dear!&quot;</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page316" id="page316"></a>[pg&nbsp;316]</span></p>

<p class="h2">CHAPTER XXIII<br />
<span class="smcap">haste to the wedding!</span></p>

<p class="indent">Well! that is really all. Tom had come
home: those four little words hold the rest
of Kitty Ross&#39;s story.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;The Duke of Lee</span><br />
<span class="i0">Would married be</span><br />
<span class="i0">To a gentlewoman of high quality.&quot;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">And</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;How happy would that gentlewoman be</span><br />
<span class="i0">To be blessed with the Duke&#39;s good company!&quot;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">But&mdash;the refrain begins with &quot;Marry!&quot; Will you
hear about the wedding? I came on for it, of course:
I would have come ten times as far. Of course, too,
if Tom had had his way, the way of his first masculine
dash for possession, he and Kitty would have been
married the morning after his arrival, with Sarepta
for sole witness; but Kitty was firm. It would never
do: Cyrus&#39;s feelings would be hurt.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You don&#39;t know, darling, how perfectly angelic
everybody has been to me, from the very moment I
arrived. Why, Tom,&mdash;don&#39;t, dear! how <i>can</i> I talk
when you&mdash;why, all these angel people wanted me to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page317" id="page317"></a>[pg&nbsp;317]</span>
come and <i>live</i> with them!&quot; Kitty very large-eyed with
affectionate gratitude.</p>

<p class="indent">Tom opined it was like their impudence! and
promptly repeated a man&oelig;uvre considered by him
highly original, which resulted in the total eclipse of
Kitty, all except the top of her little fair head. They
were sitting on the old leather sofa in the sitting-room.
It was a short sofa, and Kitty now decreed
that Tom was to sit at the further end, and stay there,
unless he would behave and listen to her. He couldn&#39;t
hear unless he held her hand&mdash;both hands? What
nonsense! Well, then&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You see, dear! Cyrus is the blessedest place in
the world, and the <i>only</i> place to live in; but there
aren&#39;t many&mdash;many <i>occasions</i>, you see, Tom. Now a
wedding is an occasion! Aunt Johanna&#39;s was delightful,
but it had to be very small, because the Judge&mdash;I
mean Uncle Edward&mdash;can&#39;t <i>abide</i> occasions.&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No more can I,&quot; said Tom.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;You&#39;ll have to abide them, sir! what are you a
duke for, I should like to know? For me? That is
no answer. Well&mdash;so&mdash;when I saw how disappointed
they were&mdash;the Twinnies, and dear Miss Caddies, and
the Chanter girls, and&mdash;oh, everybody except just the
few people who <i>had</i> to be asked&mdash;I said then that if
ever I <i>should</i> be married&mdash;though I never expected to
be then&mdash;I would have a Real Wedding, and ask
Everybody! Oh, Tommy! you know I heard&mdash;&mdash;&quot;
Here followed an account of Tom&#39;s reported marriage
to the cattle king&#39;s widow, marble palace and all. Tom
shouted with laughter.</p>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page318" id="page318"></a>[pg&nbsp;318]</span>
&quot;Good old Mother Harris! Sixty years old, and
weighs two hundred pounds; that is rich! She&#39;s married
a Leigh all right: Tim, her head stockman. She&#39;s
a good friend of mine, though, Kitty. Darling&mdash;Well,
I <i>have</i> to have just one, after being married to
Aunt Harris. Go on, you little precious, precious&mdash;&mdash;&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;That&#39;s all!&quot; said Kitty, demurely. &quot;I want to
have a Real Wedding, and to ask Everybody: Savory
Bite and all, Tommy!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">So she had, and so she did. Some of the neighbors
thought they would wait for the return of Judge and
Mrs. Peters in September: but these did not know
Tom Lee. Tom sent a cable the morning after his
arrival. &quot;Marry Kitty. When? Lee.&quot; The answer
flashed back: &quot;To-morrow. Joy. Peters.&quot; So <i>that</i>
was all right.</p>

<p class="indent">It was the Reallest Wedding that ever was. The
day was made on purpose, of diamond and sapphire
and much fine gold of June sunshine. The church&mdash;I
beg its pardon! the meeting-house; the beloved white
box with its beautiful spire, its square pews, its towering
pulpit, its everything that a meeting-house should
have&mdash;was trimmed with masses of white lilac and
spiræa, till, as the <i>Centinel</i> said next day, it was a
Palace of Purity and a Temple of Troth. Madam
Flynt gave the bride away; the dear bride, more lovely
in her simple white gown than words can say. The
bridegroom looked like Cortez the Conqueror, Miss
Croly said: &quot;So majestic, yet so affable, my love!&quot;
There were six bridesmaids in pink muslin; I myself,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page319" id="page319"></a>[pg&nbsp;319]</span>
the three Chanters, Lissy Wibird, who was to be married
next month, and&mdash;I wonder if anybody in the
world except Kitty Ross would have asked Cissy
Sharpe to stand up with her! We all protested, I am
rather ashamed to remember; but Kitty said Cissy was
a schoolmate just as much as the rest of us, and it
would be unkind to leave her out; and I am bound to
say it was the making over of Cissy, who really was
pathetic in her adoration of Kitty ever after.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Jordano was head usher, cloak and all, very
superb; the others were Mr. Mallow and Billy and
the three Chanters. I don&#39;t know which was prouder,
the eldest usher, or the youngest. Each thought it
preposterous for the other to figure in &quot;such a caparison,&quot;
as Mr. Mallow put it, but that did not matter.
Sixty and sixteen, Kitty loved them both: loved everybody,
and Tom loved them because she did. They
even had qualms of conscience about Wilson Wibird:
but Wilson had left town shortly before.</p>

<p class="indent">Miss Croly played the wedding march, shedding so
many happy tears that the notes were not all exactly
right, but nobody minded; the choir sang, &quot;The Voice
That Breathed&quot;: Mr. Chanter kissed the bride; it was
over, and Mr. and Mrs. Thomas Lee came down the
aisle, smiling greetings on either hand. Then who
so glorious as John Tucker, sitting on the box of the
barouche (the only one in Cyrus!) holding the reins
over Dan and Pilot, who wondered why they were
harnessed together, but comported themselves with
perfect dignity? White cockade in his hat, white bow
on his whip, white rosettes on the horses&#39; ears, brand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page320" id="page320"></a>[pg&nbsp;320]</span>
new white reins&mdash;who so glorious as John Tucker?
Rheumatism? He never heard of such a thing!</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Don&#39;t sit too straight, John!&quot; said Tom. &quot;You
might strain your back!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Roars of laughter from John Tucker at this subtle
jest. So, through the Street (in case anybody had not
been able to get to the church; but apparently everybody
had!) up the hill, round the Common in state, to
the door of Ross House.</p>

<p class="indent">And the door was opened by Sarepta, the faithful
retainer, in her best dress, with tears in her faithful
eyes? Nothing of the sort! If any one thought
Sarepta could bother with doors to-day&mdash;no, Jenny
couldn&#39;t either! Jenny could set the door open and
then set down and beat them eggs. If folks didn&#39;t
know enough to come in, they could stay out. The
idea!</p>

<p class="indent">So the door stood wide open, as indeed was its
summer habit, and in came the happy pair, and after
them trooped Cyrus, which had walked across the
Common while they were driving round through the
Street. <i>All</i> Cyrus! except dear Miss Anne Peace, who
had whipped up the back stairs so as to be ready to
&quot;help off&quot; in the ladies&#39; dressing-room. Why, would
any one have believed it? Savory Bite came! Tom
had called on him, it afterward transpired, and told
him that if he didn&#39;t come, he would find his kitchen
painted green some fine morning. So here he was, to
the amazement of all, in decent black, cracking his
finger-joints, sidling off if any one spoke to him, but
evidently enjoying himself in his way. He spent much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page321" id="page321"></a>[pg&nbsp;321]</span>
of the time in the upper room where the presents were
displayed: the most delightful presents that any one
ever had, Kitty thought. Madam Flynt&#39;s emeralds
were perhaps the most valuable, from a pecuniary
point of view (if one excepted the jewels that Tom
had been producing at intervals ever since his return)
but just as precious in Kitty&#39;s eyes was the Lowestoft
tea-set, hitherto the pride of &quot;Miss Bygoods&#39;&quot; china
cupboard; the pink lustre jug over which the Misses
Caddie shed tears at parting (yet which they gave so
gladly!) the unparalleled collection of &quot;wipers,&quot; roller-towels,
and dusters, all hemmed by Mr. Mallow&#39;s own
hands and tied up in dozens with pink ribbons: the
centrepiece which Mr. Josiah Jebus regarded as the
&quot;shay-dove&quot; of his professional life.</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;But meanwhile in the kitchen</span><br />
<span class="i2">Great deeds of arms were wrought;</span><br />
<span class="i0">There S&#39;repta the Dictator,</span><br />
<span class="i2">And there Cheesemanius fought!&quot;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent">as Tom said. Uncle Ivory Cheeseman had asked the
privilege of frosting the cakes; asked it of Sarepta as
one potentate of another, conferring and asking honor.
Sarepta, who had hitherto refused all offers of assistance
save from Sarah and Abby Ann, accepted this:
royalty received royalty; Uncle Ivory ranged through
the kitchen like the Frost King in person. According
to Sarepta, he frosted everything he could lay
hands on.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;My land!&quot; she said. &quot;I had to ketch him by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page322" id="page322"></a>[pg&nbsp;322]</span>
coat-tails to stop him from frosting the boned turkey!
why, the man was fairly loony!&quot;</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Cheeseman was not so &quot;loony&quot; but that he
could appreciate the triumphs of a fellow-artist. I
fancy he did not really mean to frost the boned turkey:
he certainly hung over it in fervent admiration, pronouncing
it a work of art, sir! When it came to the
<i>café mousse</i>, words failed him. He cast several
thoughtful glances at Sarepta and finally asked in a
casual way if she had ever thought of changing her
state.</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;No, I ain&#39;t!&quot; said Sarepta.</p>

<p class="indent">After another glance, he didn&#39;t know but she was
wise, and expected a single life was more handy like
when one was used to it.</p>

<p class="indent">Well! the Olympian Banquet&mdash;I should say the wedding
breakfast&mdash;was served, and was enjoyed as I
cannot think any banquet ever was before. Mr. Mallow
and Mr. Jordano made speeches, each in his own
vein. The former said well! well! well! how about it?
He expected if Kitty and Tom conjingled as well as
what we and this dandy spread did, there wouldn&#39;t any
<i>divorcee</i> lawyer make his fortune out of <i>them</i>, what
say? He, Mr. Mallow, wasn&#39;t no hand at speechifyin&#39;,
we all knew that, but he wished &#39;em joy&mdash;here the
good man&#39;s voice quavered a little&mdash;and he looked to
Mr. Jordano to speak up for him and the rest of us.</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. Jordano rose with dignity, his cloak thrown
back over one shoulder in his best style. (Yes, it <i>was</i>
funny to wear it at table, but he wanted to so dreadfully,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page323" id="page323"></a>[pg&nbsp;323]</span>
I had not the heart to say &quot;No!&quot; when he consulted
me!)</p>

<p class="indent">&quot;Ladies and gentlemen-ten-ten!&quot; He swept a splendid
circular bow. &quot;On this auspicious occasion, when
the ashes&mdash;I would say the spirits of our fathers look
down from the azure empyrean to hallow this union;
when I gaze upon the countenances of the bride in her
radiant youth-tooth-tooth, and of the groom in the&mdash;a&mdash;stalwart
pride of his manhood; when I see highly
esteemed neighbors&mdash;I will venture to say <i>friends</i>&mdash;(&quot;Hear!
Hear!&quot; and applause) gathered in festal
garb-barb-barb about a banquet so, so&mdash;<i>sumptuoso</i>, if
I may use the language of sunny Italy, as to impart a
truly Olympian flavor to the occasion; I cannot but
feel, in the words of the poet, the heart in my dumb
breast flutter and sing-ting-ting. No poet, but a humble
worshiper at the shrine of the Muses, I have ventured
to&mdash;a&mdash;shall I say crystallize these flutterings&mdash;into&mdash;&mdash;&quot;
Mr. Jordano produced a paper from beneath
his cloak&mdash;&quot;into the following brief roundelay.&quot;
And clearing his throat nervously, the paper trembling
in his fingers, the dear gentleman read as follows:</p>

<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&quot;A simple scribe, I yet imbibe</span><br />
<span class="i2">Of Helicon a draught,</span><br />
<span class="i0">And pray that doom o&#39;er bride and groom</span><br />
<span class="i2">The airs of Eden waft!</span><br />
<span class="i0">Ay! may they capture of wedded rapture</span><br />
<span class="i2">A homogeneous whole,</span><br />
<span class="i0">Good angels shedding upon their wedding</span><br />
<span class="i2">The blessings of the soul!&quot;</span><br />
</div>
</div>

<p class="indent"><span class="pagenum"><a name="page324" id="page324"></a>[pg&nbsp;324]</span>
This effusion was received with wild applause, and
Mr. Jordano sat down very happy. Tom, his eyes
dancing, replied briefly, making us all laugh. Then
Kitty spoke a few tremulous words that made us all
cry, herself included. Then she floated up the stairs,
a white cloud (throwing back her bouquet, which dear
Miss Croly caught!) and floated down a gray one,
touched with morning rose; and then&mdash;then the Duke
of Lee took his bride away, while we all waved our
handkerchiefs and cried and laughed and showered
blessings after them. And by and by he brought her
back to live in blessed Cyrus, which really is the only
place to live in, &quot;and no lady in the City could with her
compare!&quot;</p>

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement

works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
